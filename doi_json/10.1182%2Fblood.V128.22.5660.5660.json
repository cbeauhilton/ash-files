    "abstract_text": "Background: Selinexor is a Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compound that binds to and inhibits XPO1 mediated nuclear export, resulting in nuclear accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) including p53, pRB, and I\u03baB-\u03b1. Selinexor has therapeutic benefit both pre-clinically and clinically (NCT01607892, NCT02336815) in multiple myeloma (MM). It has been previously demonstrated that the extent of NF-\u03baB transcriptional inhibition is one of the critical mechanisms contributing to the efficacy and/or resistance to selinexor in cells. However, the mechanism leading to NF-\u03baB inhibition after selinexor treatment is not fully understood. We hypothesized that the level of the cellular inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, I\u03baB-\u03b1, and its compartmental localization play an important role in NF-\u03baB transactivation and response to selinexor. In this study, we investigate the effect of selinexor treatment on MM cells with low expression of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and high NF-kB activity in order to understand the mechanism of NF-\u03baB inhibition by selinexor. Methods: IM9 and RPMI-8226cells were treated with selinexor in the presence or absence of 20 ng/mL tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1; inflammatory mimic) and whole protein lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. Cytotoxic effects of selinexor were evaluated using standard viability assays. I\u03baB-\u03b1 knockdown was performed using transfection of specific siRNA duplexes. NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity was analyzed using an ELISA assay. Results: Selinexor induces nuclear localization of I\u03baB-\u03b1 in MM cells. RNAi of I\u03baB-\u03b1 in MM cells reduced the cytotoxic effects of selinexor by 10-fold. In addition, knockdown of I\u03baB-\u03b1 reduces the synergy of the selinexor plus proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib or carfilzomib) combination. This data suggests that in MM, I\u03baB-\u03b1 plays a major role in cellular sensitivity to selinexor potentially through NF-\u03baB activity. Selinexor inhibited NF-kB transcriptional activity in IM9 and RPMI-8226 cells with IC 50 of 1079 nM and 591 nM respectively. Although the difference in NF-\u03baB activity IC 50 is only 2-fold between the two MM cell lines (MTT IC 50 s are ~100 nM), IM9 cells have a 100-fold higher basal NF-kB activity when compared to RPMI-8226 cells. Under TNF\u03b1 stimulation NF-kB activity was induced by 1.5- and 35-fold in IM9 and RPMI-8226, respectively. We observed that selinexor treatment caused a dose dependent inhibition of I\u03baB kinase (IKK)-mediated phosphorylation of serine 32/36 on I\u03baB-\u03b1 and serine 536 on the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit (RelA) upon TNF\u03b1 stimulation in both cell lines. In RPMI-8226 cells, selinexor reduced TNF\u03b1-induced I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner and protected I\u03baB-\u03b1 from degradation. In IM9 cells that have high basal NF-\u03baB activity, TNF\u03b1 did not induce NF-kB activity or cause I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation. However, selinexor treatment inhibited NF-kB activity below its basal level (70% reduction) which resulted in dose dependent reduction in the level of I\u03baB-\u03b1 protein perhaps through inhibition of NF-\u03baB transcriptional control of I\u03baB-\u03b1 mRNA expression. Conclusions: I\u03baB-\u03b1 plays a major role in the cellular cytotoxicity of selinexor in cancer cells. Multiple myeloma cells lose sensitivity to selinexor treatment upon I\u03baB-\u03b1 silencing, which in turn reduces the cytotoxicity of selinexor. TNF\u03b1 stimulation induces the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65 subunit and I\u03baB-\u03b1 through increased IKK activity resulting in I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation and NF-\u03baB activation. In RPMI-8226 cells, selinexor treatment blocked TNF\u03b1-induced degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1. However, in IM9 cells TNF\u03b1 alone did not have any significant effect on I\u03baB-\u03b1 which might be due to the high basal NF-kB activity. Interestingly, I\u03baB-\u03b1 is also a transcriptional target of NF-kB. In IM9 cells, selinexor treatment reduces NF-kB activity below the high basal level in a dose dependent manner resulting in near complete inhibition of NF-kB-controlled I\u03baB-\u03b1 mRNA transcription and a loss of the I\u03baB-\u03b1 protein. Ultimately, selinexor treatment inhibits cell viability and NF-kB transcriptional activity regardless of basal NF-\u03baB activity in MM cells. Because of this I\u03baB-\u03b1/NF-kB transcriptional mechanism, selinexor treatment can inhibit both chronic (unresponsive to TNF\u03b1) and acute (TNF\u03b1-simulated) inflammatory signaling which makes selinexor an applicable therapy to cancer cells with a variety of aberrant signaling pathways.
