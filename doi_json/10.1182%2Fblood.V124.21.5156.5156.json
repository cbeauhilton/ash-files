    "abstract_text": "Objective To explore the global DNA methylation and the expression of regulatory genes for methylation in CD4 + T cells of the patients with immune related pancytopenia (IRP) and explore the role of methylation in pathogenesis of IRP. Methods Thirty IRP patients (untreated, n=15; remission, n=15) and 15 healthy donors as controls were enrolled from December 2012 to December 2013. CD4 + T cells were sorted by immunomagnetic separation. The global DNA methylation was tested with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA levels of DNA methylation-related regulating genes, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and methylated CpG binding proteins (MBDs), were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results The level of global DNA methylation in peripheral blood CD4 + T cells of untreated IRP patients (3.525%\u00b12.046%)and remission patients (4.790%\u00b11.471%) were significantly lower than that of normal controls (10.101%\u00b13.449%) respectively (both P<0.05). DNMT3b mRNA level of untreated IRP patients (1.332\u00b10.785) was significantly lower than that of normal controls (2.077\u00b11.059) in CD4 + T cells ( P <0.05). The mRNA expression of MBD2 was significantly higher in CD4 + T cells from untreated and remission IRP patients (2.999\u00b11.601, 2.055\u00b11.576) than that in controls (0.581\u00b10.247) (both P<0.05). The MBD4 mRNA level was significantly higher in CD4 + T cells from untreated IRP patients (2.736\u00b12.719) compared to that in normal controls (1.167\u00b11.006) ( p <0.05). DNMT3b mRNA expression and CD4 + T cell DNA methylation to be positive correlated within IRP patients ( r =0.569, p <0.01). The MBD2 mRNA expression negatively correlated with CD4 + T cell DNA methylation and the ratio of Th1/Th2 ( r =-0.763, p <0.001; r = -0.652, p <0.05). The global methylation of CD4 + T cells negatively related to the ratio of CD5 + B cells ( r = -0.439, p <0.05). Conclusions The globe DNA hypomethylation and abnormal expression of DNA methylation-related enzymes in peripheral blood CD4 + T cells may be related with the pathogenesis of IRP.
