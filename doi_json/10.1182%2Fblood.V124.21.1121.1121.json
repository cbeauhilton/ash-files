    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Adoptive transfer of T cells genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has begun to show impressive clinical results. The efficacy of T cell therapy is dependent not only on tumor recognition, but also on the survival and expansion of T cells following infusion. T cells modified with CAR constructs encoding costimulatory domains such as CD28 or 4-1BB have the capacity to rapidly proliferate in vivo , but severe toxicities have been observed due to unchecked T cell activation. Thus, strategies to regulate T cell activation in vivo would allow physicians to prevent toxicities and maximize anti-tumor efficacy. Here, we describe a novel T cell costimulation switch, inducible MyD88/CD40 (iMC), that can be activated by a small molecule chemical inducer of dimerization, AP1903, to enhance survival and drive T cell proliferation. Methods: T cells were activated with anti-CD3/28 antibodies and subsequently transduced with a biscistronic retrovirus encoding myristolated tandem AP1903 binding domains (FKBPv36), cloned in-frame with MyD88 and CD40 cytoplasmic signaling molecules, and truncated CD19 to identify transduced T cells (SFG-iMC.2A.\u0394CD19). Control vectors without signaling elements, or with only MyD88 or cytoplasmic CD40 were also used to generate gene-modified T cell lines. iMC activation was measured by treating T cells with and without AP1903 and measuring cytokine production by ELISA, and assessing cell surface activation markers by flow cytometry. Co-activation of T cells through CD3\u03b6 in combination with iMC was accomplished using anti-CD3 antibodies, or by co-transducing T cells with first generation CAR constructs recognizing prostate stem cell antigen or CD19 (PSCA.\u03b6 or CD19.\u03b6, respectively), and coculturing T cells with PSCA + (Capan-1) or CD19 + tumor cell lines (Raji, Daudi and Nalm-1) with and without AP1903. Efficacy of iMC-modified CAR T cells were assessed using NOD scid gamma (NSG) immune deficient mice engrafted with tumor cell lines followed by intravenous injection of T cells. The iMC costimulatory molecule was subsequently activated in vivo by intraperitoneal injection of AP1903 (5 mg/kg). Tumor burden was assessed and T cell expansion in vivo was measured by bioluminescent imaging using an IVIS instrument. Results: T cells transduced with iMC produce cytokines (e.g. IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) in response to AP1903. iMC activation permits T cell survival in the absence of growth cytokines, such as IL-2, but by itself is not sufficient to induce IL-2 production or autonomous growth. Interestingly, AP1903-induction of MyD88 or cytoplasmic CD40 alone showed minimal T cell activation, suggesting potential synergy of the two signaling molecules. However, co-activation of the T cell receptor (TCR) with soluble anti-CD3 and iMC with AP1903 upregulated CD25 expression, induced IL-2 production and promoted T cell expansion. Importantly, endogenous TCR signaling could be substituted by a PSCA-specific CAR linked to the CD3 \u03b6 endodomain (PSCA.\u03b6 CAR), where co-activation of iMC by AP1903, and CAR by tumor cells expressing PSCA (Capan-1) induced high levels of IL-2 secretion, CD25 upregulation and rapid T cell proliferation. Similar results were achieved using T cells transduced with iMC-enabled CD19 CAR (SFG-iMC.2A.CD19.\u03b6) when cocultured with CD19 + lymphoma cell lines. Treatment of tumor bearing immunodeficient mice with T cells modified with iMC and PSCA.\u03b6 CAR showed enhanced antitumor efficacy when mice were administered with AP1903 dimerizer. Bioluminescence imaging also demonstrated marked proliferation and persistence of iMC-transduced T cells in response to AP1903 administration. Following AP1903 withdrawal, T cell levels declined, consistent with the requirement for costimulation in combination with CAR activation. Summary: Inducible MyD88/CD40 represents a novel activation switch that can be used to provide a controllable costimulatory signal to T cells transduced with a first generation CAR. The separation of the cytolytic signal 1 (CD3 \u03b6) domain from signal 2 costimulation (iMC) provides a unique mechanism by which T cells can be expanded only in response to both AP1903 and tumor antigen, or reduced in number by withdrawal of AP1903-induced iMC costimulation.
