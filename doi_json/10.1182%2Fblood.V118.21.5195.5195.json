    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5195 High-grade lymphomas are aggressive but largely curable, whereas low-grade lymphomas are indolent, but frequently recur to be incurable, paradoxically. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been known to participate for reconstituting microenvironment. Studies show that signalings between normal lymphoid cells and stromal cells were frequently altered in high grade lymphomas, but relatively conserved in low grade lymphomas. However, which cell and mechanism is responsible for lymphoma recurrence remains unclear. Here we hypothesized that the interaction with stroma may play a role for lymphoma cell growth and survival. For this, we investigated the effect of MSCs on lymphoma cell growth and chemo-resistance by using a coculture system with MSCs (derived from tonsil), as a stromal microenvironment for lymphoma cells. First, coculture of lymphoma cell line (Pfeiffer) and primary lymphoma cells with/without MSCs for 3 days showed that the MSC-cocultured cells grew more rapidly (1.4 times and 1.8 times for Pfeiffer and primary cells, respectively) than MSC-free lymphoma cells. To further investigate the underlying mechanism of promoting growth, lymphoma cells were cocultured with MSCs in the presence or absence of transwell filter. At day 4, the proliferation of lymphoma cells in the absence of transwell was 3.5 times higher than in the presence of transwell. Interestingly, the lymphoma cells cocultured with MSCs showed increased expression of CXCR4 compared with lymphoma cells cultured alone. When the cyto-protective effect of MSCs was examined by doxorubicin treatment (1ug/ml) in the presence or absence of MSCs, 91% of MSC-cocultured cells survived, whereas only 28% of stroma-free cultured cells survived. These results demonstrate that the direct contact interaction with stroma might be important for lymphoma cell growth and survival. In conclusion, our data suggest that the interaction with stromal microenvironment is an important factor for survival of lymphoma cells which cells might be responsible for chemoresistance, and raise the possibility that the stromal interaction could be a potential target for lymphoma treatment.
