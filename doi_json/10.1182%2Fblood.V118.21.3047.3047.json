    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3047 Up to date, there are many conflicting reports existing in which different gene variants have been proposed to have influence on the outcome of allogeneic transplant. Hereby many of the published studies bare a distressing high weakness in the study set up as for example low number of study patients, large heterogeneity of donor types and/or GVHD prophlyaxis regimens and/or T cell depleting of grafts and/or type of conditioning regimens. In this study we aimed to evaluate in 285 patients and their HLA identical sibling donors the following in table 1 shown 48 different gene variants from which were reported to have influence on the outcome of transplants. Our study group consists of a homogenous group of patients who underwent all a non T cell-depleted transplantation after receiving a myeloablative conditioning regimen and a GVHD prophylaxis with MTX and CSA or CSA and MMF. Patients were transplanted from a HLA-identical sibling donor for various diseases like acute leukemia, CML, MDS, lymphoma and MM between January 2000 and June 2010 at our center We could confirm an influence of gene variants of NOD2 (80, 4% vs 61, 6%, p=0.0013), IL23R, MTHFR1298, and LCT 13910 on the occurrence of acute GVHD grade 1\u20134 on recipients side, whereas no influence was seen of any gene variant on the occurrence of grade 2\u20134 acute GVHD. But, NOD2 gene variants had a significant (p=0.041) influence on the occurrence of severe acute GVHD grade 3\u20134. The occurrence of acute GVHD grade 1\u20134 was significantly modified by the detection of following gene variants at donors side: CCL5 28 promotor (30, 8% vs 69, 2% p=0.033), GSTP 313 (74, 3% vs 62, 4%, p=0.043);IL23R (69, 9% vs 48%, p=0.049), MTHFR129 (86, 7 vs 37, 3% p=.0.06), MTHFR 677 (53, 8% vs 70%, p=0.05), NOD2 (65, 9% vs 84, 4%, p=0.01). Acute GVHD grade 2 \u20134 was significantly influenced only by GSTP (p<0.015) and MTHFR129 (p<0.025). Severe acute GVHD grade 3\u20134 was only influenced by GSTP gene variants (p<0.04). The 5-year TRM was influenced by MTHFR677 (30, 4% vs 19, 2%, p=0.05) at recipient side, and at donor side by the genes IL18 Rap (38, 5% vs 19%, p=0.046) and CYP1B1 (28, 8% vs 15, 6%, p=0.07). IL10 gene variants at recipients side influenced the 5-year OS significantly, at donor side the 5-year OS was influenced by CTLA4 (69, 4 vs 52, 2%, p=0.06) IL23R (53, 6% vs 71, 6%, p=0.044) and MBL2CD55 48, 9% vs 65, 2% p=0.02). In this study we could confirm that the above described gene variants might influence moderately the transplant outcome and may therefore be qualified for screening in patients and their respective donors prior to transplant.
