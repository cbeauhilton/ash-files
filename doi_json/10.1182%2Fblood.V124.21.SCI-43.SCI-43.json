    "abstract_text": "Recent studies have suggested not only that stem cells have different metabolic requirements than terminally differentiated cells, but also that metabolic intermediates may play a role in the maintenance of stem cells. It has long been clear that changes in acetylation and methylation of histones, as well as methylation of DNA play critical roles in deciding cell fate. The availability of critical intermediates in metabolism, especially S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), acetyl-CoA, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and a-ketoglutarate play critical roles in modulating acetylation and methylation of histones and methylation of DNA. In the course of evaluating an unusual requirement of threonine (Thr) for the growth of murine embryonic stem cells, we found that metabolism of Thr to glycine (Gly) and the subsequent use of the methyl group of Gly for converting homocysteine to methionine is critical for maintaining high levels of SAM and low levels of S-adenosyl-homocysteine. Importantly, depletion of Thr from the media resulted in decreased tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine-4 (H3K4me3), leading to slowed growth and increased differentiation. Thus, abundance of SAM appears to influence H3K4me3, providing a possible mechanism by which modulation of a metabolic pathway might influence stem cell fate. Demethylation of histones and DNA can also be controlled by metabolic intermediates. Mutated forms of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 that drive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers, produce an oncometabolite (2-hydrogyglutarate) that can compete with the a-ketoglutarate requirement for enzymes involved in hydroxy-methylation and subsequent demethylation of DNA and histones. Recent studies indicate that 2-hydroxyglutarate plays a role in blocking differentiation of cancer cells. These and other observations linking intermediates in metabolism to stem cell maintenance will be discussed.
