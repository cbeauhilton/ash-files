    "abstract_text": "Background: Hemoglobin (Hb) analysis sometimes yields unidentified Hb variants. However, there have been no validated phenotypic characteristics differentiating between a- and b-variants. Furthermore, amplification of \u03b1-globin genes are problematic due to almost identical \u03b11-and \u03b12-gene sequences. Methods: Cases showing unidentified variants on isoelectric focusing (IEF) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) during 2012-2013 were subjected to direct sequencing of \u03b11-, \u03b12- and b-globin genes. The appropriate cutoff Hb variant percentages were determined using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. The distinctive phenotypes of a-globin mutations were used to construct an algorithm which was subsequently validated in the other cohort of unknown variants. Results: The characteristics that can differentiate between subjects with rare a-globin variants (N = 39) and b-variants (N = 24) were the presence of unknown variants of HbA 2 (23.1% sensitivity and 100% specificity) and/or Hb variant levels of < 37% on IEF and < 31% on HPLC (100% sensitivity and 100% specificity). Applying these phenotypes (Figure 1) to another validation cohort (N = 67), a-globin variants could be correctly identified with 100% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity. Among the total of 72 subjects with rare a-globin variants, Hb Hekinan (69.4%) was the most common followed by Hb Q-Thailand (8.3%). Other mutations were very rare. This was the first report of Hb Lansing, Hb Owari, Hb G-Georgia, Hb Port Phillip, Hb I and Hb J-Singapore in Thai population. When iron deficiency anemia was excluded, these \u03b1-globin variants demonstrated normal or \u03b1 + -thalassemia phenotypes. The percentages of Hb variants and their phenotypes were determined by the presence of mutations on either \u03b11-globin or \u03b12-globin gene and co-inherited \u03b1-globin gene deletions. Notably, some a-globin variants such as Hb Hekinan and Hb G-Georgia showed more severe phenotypes similar to thalassemia intermedia when they were co-inherited with other a- and/or \u03b2-globin gene mutations. We hereby reported the Hb Lansing mutation on the \u03b11-globin gene coexisting with a + -thalassemia resulting in increased Hb Lansing percentage and hence falsely low oxygen saturation. Conclusions: This is the largest series of rare \u03b1-globin mutations. An unknown Hb variant level is the most effective criteria to suggest \u03b1-globin variants. Our proposed simple algorithm and DNA sequencing protocol are effective for characterization of \u03b1-globin variants. Table 1.
