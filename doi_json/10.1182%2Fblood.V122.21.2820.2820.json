    "abstract_text": "Background Ruxolitinib is a potent JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor that has demonstrated improved survival, rapid and durable improvements in splenomegaly, disease-related symptoms, and quality of life measures in the 2 phase 3 COMFORT studies in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). Prolonged survival was observed in patients receiving ruxolitinib compared with both placebo (COMFORT-I) and best available therapy (BAT; COMFORT-II). Here, we conducted a pooled analysis of overall survival (OS) in the COMFORT studies. Methods The COMFORT studies are randomized, phase 3 studies comparing the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib with placebo or BAT in patients with intermediate-2\u2013 or high-risk primary MF, post-polycythemia MF, or post-essential thrombocythemia MF. COMFORT-I is a double-blind study whereas COMFORT-II is open label. Patients initially received ruxolitinib 15 or 20 mg bid based on their platelet counts at baseline (100-200 and > 200 x 10 9 /L, respectively) and were individually titrated to maximize safety and efficacy. The patient populations were generally similar and have been fully described. Patients were allowed to cross over from the control arms of each study upon protocol-defined progression events (primarily progressive splenomegaly, defined as a \u2265 25% increase in spleen volume from baseline or on-study nadir in COMFORT-I and \u2013II, respectively). At the time of analysis, all ongoing control patients had crossed over to ruxolitinib. OS was a secondary endpoint in both studies. Here, OS was analyzed in an intent-to-treat analysis using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model estimating effects of treatment, study, and IPSS risk (model 1). Effect of baseline spleen volume (per 5 dL) was evaluated using a Cox model adjusting for treatment, study, and IPSS risk (model 2). Two patients in COMFORT without defined IPSS risk status were excluded from model 1; 4 patients without baseline spleen volume measurements were excluded from model 2. For these exploratory analyses, all P values are provided for descriptive purposes only. Results Overall, 301 patients were randomized to ruxolitinib (COMFORT-I, n = 155; COMFORT-II, n = 146), and 227 patients were randomized to placebo (n = 154) or BAT (n = 73). In the combined ruxolitinib group, 162 patients (54%) had high-risk MF, and 138 (46%) had intermediate-2 risk at baseline by IPSS criteria compared with 135 (59%) and 91 (40%) patients in the combined control group, respectively. At this 3-year update, 71 patients (24%) died in the ruxolitinib group compared with 76 patients (33%) in the control group. Survival was consistent across both studies (HR = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.6; P = .54) and represented an OS benefit in favor of ruxolitinib ( Figure A ); the risk of death was reduced by 35% with ruxolitinib treatment compared with control (HR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.90; P = .01). Patients with intermediate-2\u2013MF had a reduced risk of death compared with high-risk patients (HR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.33-0.67; P < .0001). Moreover, patients with high-risk MF who received ruxolitinib treatment had a Kaplan Meier\u2013estimated survival similar to that of intermediate-2\u2013risk patients in the control group ( Figure B ). Among all patients, larger spleen volume at baseline was prognostic for shortened survival; the risk of death increased by 9% for each additional 5 dL in spleen volume at baseline (HR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.15; P = .003). Further analysis to evaluate the impact of potentially prognostic and predictive factors at baseline on survival as well as association of other relevant clinical endpoints, such as dynamics of spleen and symptom reduction, with survival will be presented.

These benefits were seen for both intermediate-2\u2013 and high-risk patients, and high-risk patients in the ruxolitinib group appeared to have improved survival similar to that of intermediate-2\u2013risk patients in the control group.
