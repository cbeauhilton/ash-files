    "abstract_text": "Annamycin (Ann) is an anti-tumoral anthracycline whose anti-leukemia activity is relatively unaffected by P-glycoprotein-related multidrug resistance. Unlike for the related doxorubicin (DOX), Ann accumulates in multidrug resistant cell lines, which is accompanied by DNA damage and apoptosis. In preclinical toxicology studies, in contrast to DOX, free Ann displayed a greatly reduced cardiotoxicity, while L-Ann appeared to be non-cardiotoxic. A liposomal formulation of Ann, termed L-Annamycin (L-Ann), is currently evaluated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Anti-leukemia activity of Ann was demonstrated in several leukemia models as judged by circulating blast cytoreduction and extension of overall survival. However, the efficacy of L-Ann in the microenvironment of the bone marrow and other organ tissues remains unclear. In the current study, we assessed the anti-AML efficacy of Ann in a novel AML model that allows visualizing the dynamics of individual AML cells in vivo by two-photon microscopy. In this model, mouse AML cells bearing the MLL/ENL-FLT3/ITD[p53-/-] mutations co-express high levels of the cyan fluorescent protein mTurquoise2. Upon intravenous infusion of several tens of thousands cells into syngeneic immunocompetent C57BL6 mice, lethal AML disease reliably develops within 2 weeks. Using host mice expressing appropriate fluorescence reporter genes, the bright cyan fluorescence enables sensitive intravital imaging of individual AML cells in the context of organ architecture. Using this model in Thy1-RFP reporter mice expressing red fluorescence in all organ tissues with the blood flow marked by BSA-AF647 fluorescence, we evaluated AML cellularity reduction in the bone marrow and other organs after a single dose of L-Ann as well as in response to chronic treatment. In addition, we assessed the localization of the surviving AML cells at a high spatial resolution. We evaluated the in vivo organ biodistribution of intravenously infused L-Ann in C57BL6 mice by flow cytometry and two-photon microscopy based on the intrinsic fluorescence of the drug. In addition, we visualized the intracellular compartmentalization of L-Ann using confocal microscopy. Consistent with in vitro findings, we observed a rapid and deep reduction of AML blasts in the peripheral blood after a single dose of L-Ann in a dose-dependent manner (1-4 mg/kg). This reduction was strongly correlated with prolongation of animal survival from 14 days (vehicle) to 37 days (L-Ann 4 mg/kg once weekly started on day 10). In vitro and intravital microscopy revealed a distinct pattern of L-Ann distribution in organ tissues, which correlated in part with the local index of AML cellularity reduction and residual disease localization. Interestingly, in addition to the expected uptake of Ann in the cell's nucleus, Ann was also accumulated in the cytosol of the cells. This bi-compartmental intracellular distribution pattern contrasted with the nuclear-only localization of DOX. Administration of L-Ann early in the course of AML resulted in occasional complete responses some of which associated with resistance to AML re-challenge, suggesting capacity for anti-AML immune memory induction. This study confirms the efficacy of the drug in the model setting of syngeneic, immune-competent AML. Besides reinforcing the rationale for further development of Annamycin in AML, this study demonstrates a highly advantageous AML mouse model that is highly informative in studies of AML pharmacology, minimum residual disease (MRD), microenvironment and immunology.
