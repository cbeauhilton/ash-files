    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1723 Introduction and Objective: A large number of patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) need blood transfusions, being iron overload an inevitable consequence that may cause hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, diabetes or myocardiopathy unless it is not treated. The main objective of this study is to describe the evolution of iron overload in transfusion-dependent patients with low-risk MDS. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of the impact of iron chelation therapy on Event Free Survival (EFS) (including infections, arthropathy, diabetes mellitus, hepatic and cardiac complications), Overall Survival (OS) and Leukemia Free Survival (LFS). Methods and Patients: Retrospective observational study carried out in Haematology Departments of 47 Spanish hospitals between March 2010 and March 2011. Transfusion-dependent patients with low/intermediate-1 IPSS risk who had received \u226510 red blood cell (RBC) transfusion during at least 12 months previous to study entry were eligible. Results: A total of 263 patients were evaluated [age at diagnosis, 74 \u00b1 10.5 years]. IPSS classification was available in 82.9% included patients (lack of cytogenetics in 37 patients), classified as low risk (86%) and int-1 risk (14%). At diagnosis, 25.5% of patients had serum ferritin (SF) levels >500ng/ml, 8.7% SF>1,000ng/ml, and 22% TSI>50%. The median number of RBC transfusions per month was 2.35 RBC/month; during the course of the disease, 82.4% of patients reached SF levels >1,000ng/ml. Cardiac complications worsened/appeared in 24.4% of patients, having received a median RBC transfusions of 22 (7\u201392), and showing a median SF levels of 1,365 (735\u20133,025) ng/ml. One-hundred forty-seven (55.9%) patients started iron chelation therapy (85.5% with deferasirox) with a median number of RBC transfused of 23 (14\u201338) and a median SF levels of 1,570 (1,231.5\u20132,195) ng/ml. 71% of patients with SF>1,000ng/ml were on iron chelation therapy. Table 1 shows the results of univariate analysis of EFS, OS and LFS. As part of this study, we are currently performing a multivariate analysis whose results will be presented in forthcoming congress. Table 1. Univariate analyses of EFS, OS and LFS  . Non chelated .

View Large Conclusions: The results of this study show that a high percentage of transfusion-dependent patients with low-risk MDS (82.4%) reach SF levels >1,000ng/ml during the course of their disease. Patients on iron chelation therapy show a higher cardiac EFS, OS and LFS compared with those not treated, being deferasirox the most frequently used chelating agent in clinical practice.
