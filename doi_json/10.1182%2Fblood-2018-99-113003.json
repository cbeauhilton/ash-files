    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is an essential therapeutic modality for patients with hematological malignancies and benign blood disorders. Unfortunately, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) remains the major complication of allo-HCT and is associated with high mortality. Soluble STimulation-2 (sST2) is increased during aGVHD while regulatory T cells (Tregs) that express membrane-bound ST2 prevent GVHD through unknown mechanisms. Herein, we studied nonlymphoid tissue ST2 + Tregs in murine models of allo-HCT. Transplantation of Foxp3 - T cells and Tregs sorted from different Foxp3 reporter mice indicated that ST2 + Tregs isolated from aGVHD mice were of donor origin, thymus-derived, and predominantly intestine localized (data not shown). To further understand the mechanism, we performed a transcriptome analysis of sorted Foxp3 GFP Tregs from aGVHD mice receiving wild type (WT) CD25-depleted total T cells with either WT or ST2 -/- Foxp3 GFP Tregs in both major (B6, H-2 b \u00e0BALB/c, H-2 d , Mhc) and minor (B6, H-2 b \u00e0C3H.SW, H-2 b , miH) mismatched aGVHD models. ST2 -/- Foxp3 GFP Tregs showed decreased expression of key molecules needed for Treg function such as Foxp3 , Il2ra , Icos , Il27 , Ctla4 , and Ahr . Strikingly, transcription of RAR-related-orphan-receptor-c ( Rorc ), essential for proinflammatory IL-17 + T cells development, was the most upregulated transcript in ST2 -/- Foxp3 GFP Treg isolated from the gut in both models ( Figure 1A ). The transcriptome finding led us to investigate the frequency and function of ST2 + Tregs in the gut of naive mice deficient for Rorc. Isolation and staining of intestinal T cells showed a significant increase of ST2 + Treg frequency in the gut of Rorc -/- mice compared to WT mice: 55% vs. 12%, respectively ( Figure 1B ). Rorc -/- T cells transplantation enhanced the day 10 post-HCT frequency of intestinal ST2 + Tregs ( Figure 1C, left ) that co-expressed TIGIT and Helios expression (data not shown), and decreased aGVHD score and mortality ( Figure 1C, right ). Previous studies have shown that IL-33 signaling in Tregs elicits their amphiregulin expression and increases their ability to suppress effector T cells (Teffs). IL-23, a key proinflammatory cytokine in the maintenance and amplification of Th17/Tc17, can restrain Treg responses by inhibiting IL-33 responsiveness. Using ex vivo polyclonal Tregs from donor B6 cultured with IL-2 (control Tregs) vs IL-2+IL-33 (Treg IL-33 ) vs IL-2+IL-33+IL-23+IL-17, we found that adding IL-33 doubled the frequencies of ST2 + Tregs compared to control Tregs, and adding IL-23+IL-17 reversed this activity ( Figure 2A ). Markers of Tregs activation (KLRG1) ( Figure 2B ) and function (Helios, LAG3) (data not shown) were augmented in Treg IL-33 compared to other Treg conditions. Treg IL-33 also expressed more amphiregulin than Tregs cultured in the two other conditions ( Figure 2C ). Next, we evaluated their function in vitro and in vivo . Treg IL-33 displayed better immunosuppression than other Tregs on CD4 + T cells at a physiological Tregs:Teffs ratio of 1:12; differences were not seen at higher ratios or on suppression of CD8 + T cells ( Figure 3A). Then we examined the in vivo capacity of donor Treg IL-33 to protect from aGVHD intestinal damage by co-adoptive transfer of Tregs cultured in the three aforementioned conditions with CD25-depleted WT T cells in Mhc and miH mismatch aGVHD models. We used a physiological ratio of 1 donor Treg per 20 donor Teffs (5% of total T cells). Mice receiving Treg IL-33 showed significantly less severe aGVHD and better survival compared to those cultured either without IL-33 or with IL-33 and IL23/IL17 in both Mhc ( Figure 3B ) and miH (data not shown) mismatched aGVHD models. Analysis of intestinal T cells of these mice showed decreased total lymphocytes infiltration in the gut at day 10 after HCT, and decreased intestinal Tbet and ROR\u03b3t expressing Teffs in both Mhc ( Figure 3C ) and miH (not shown) mismatched aGVHD models. Altogether, we conclude that within GVHD target organs, ST2 + Tregs are predominantly intestine localized, and inversely correlated with RORgt in steady state and inflammatory conditions. Triggering the ST2/IL-33 pathway in Tregs prevents severe aGVHD, possibly through a dual mechanism: upregulation of amphiregulin and immunosuppression on effector T cells. Thus, Treg IL-33 is a potential cellular therapy avenue for preventing or treating aGVHD.
