    "abstract_text": "Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a systemic pro-coagulant state. Coagulation involves complex interactions between endothelial and circulating cells, cell-derived microparticles and plasma proteins. Methods: We investigated the levels of endothelial and platelet microparticles, leukocyte and platelet activation, and cell interactions in 48 patients with non-valvular AF and compared to normal controls. We performed flow cytometry in periheral venous blood to measure (1) Platelet expression of P-selectin, (2) Platelet microparticles; (3) Platelet-leukocyte conjugates; (4) Leukocyte expression of CD11b; (5) Endothelial microparticles (EMP) positive for CD31 and negative for CD42 (EMP31 + ), EMP positive for E-selectin (EMP62E + ), CD54 (EMP54 + ), or CD51 (EMP51 + ); (6) EMP54 + - and EMP62E + -leukocyte conjugates. Atrial fibrillation was confirmed electrocardiographically and left atrial volume was estimated by echocardiography. The mean age of patients with AF was 61.3\u00b112 years. Congestive heart failure was present in 54.2% of patients, hypertension in 72.9%, and diabetes mellitus in 22.9%. Most patients (81%) were receiving anticoagulant therapy and 62.5% were receiving antiplatelet medications. Calcium channel blockers or digoxin were given to 43.8% and 54.2% of patients, respectively. The mean ventricular rate was 85.5\u00b117 beats per minute, and the mean left atrial volume was 97.9 ml. Results: Patients with AF had significantly higher levels of platelet P-selectin expression and platelet-leukocyte conjugates. P-selectin expression strongly correlated with platelet-leukocyte conjugate levels (r=0.77; p<0.001; Figure 1). Patients with AF also demonstrated increased levels of free EMP31 + , EMP62E + and EMP51 + , as well as EMP62E + -lymphocyte, -monocyte and -neutrophil conjugates. Levels of free EMP54 + were lower, whereas EMP54 + - neutrophil and EMP54 + -lymphocyte conjugates were higher among patients with AF. EMP62E + -neutrophil conjugates correlated with leukocyte expression of activation marker CD11b (r=0.42; p=0.003; Figure 2) and predicted CD11b expression independently of platelet-leukocyte conjugates (r 2 increase=16%; p=0.003). Conclusions: Patients with AF have increased levels of platelet and leukocyte activation, circulating endothelial microparticles, and binding of endothelial microparticles and platelets to leukocytes. Platelet activation is a determinant of platelet-leukocyte conjugate formation in AF. The formation of EMP62E-neutrophil conjugates is a major determining factor for circulating leukocyte activation in AF. Further studies are needed to assess the correlation of these markers with the risk of thromboembolism in AF. Figure 1. View large Download slide Figure 1. View large Download slide Figure 2.
