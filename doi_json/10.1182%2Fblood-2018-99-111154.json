    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Empiric antifungal therapy (EAT) is recommended for persistent or recurrent febrile neutropenia based on an old randomized controlled trial, but such treatment is apparently overtreatment for the majority of patients. On the other hand, preemptive therapy triggered by positive blood tests for fungal antigens and/or imaging study findings was shown to increase the incidence of invasive fungal infection, and thus, a risk-based approach is important. The D-index, which is defined as the area over the neutrophil curve during neutropenia and hence reflects both the duration and depth of neutropenia (Figure 1A), enables real-time monitoring of the risk of invasive fungal infection. Previous studies showed that the cumulative D-index (c-D-index), which was calculated as cumulative D-index from the onset of neutropenia (Figure 1B), had high negative predictive values for invasive mold infection or pulmonary infection with cutoff values of 5,800 or 5,500 in high-risk neutropenic patients [J Clin Oncol 2009; 27: 3849-54. Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 2010; 16: 1355-61]. Methods: We investigated a novel approach, called D-index-guided early antifungal therapy (DET) and compared it to EAT in high-risk neutropenic patients. In the EAT group, empiric antifungal therapy was started for persistent (>=4 days) or recurrent febrile neutropenia. For patients with persistent or recurrent febrile neutropenia in the DET group, preemptive antifungal therapy was applied until c-D-index reached 5,500, but antifungal agent was initiated after c-D-index exceeded 5,500, even if there was no significant finding in serum fungal makers or imaging studies, to prevent excessive invasive fungal infection. Micafungin at 150 mg/day was administered as EAT or DET in this study. We randomized 423 patients who underwent chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for hematological malignancies, in which predicted period of neutropenia exceeded 7 days, into the EAT group or the DET group, and 413 were eligible for intent-to-treat analyses (201 patients in the EAT group, 212 patients in the DET group). The prophylactic use of fluconazole or itraconazole was allowed. Primary endpoint was the development of proven/probable invasive fungal infection. Results: Backgrounds of the patients were similar between the 2 groups (Table 1). Invasive fungal infection (proven/probable/possible) was observed in 12 patients (6.0%) of the EAT group and 5 patients (2.4%) of DET group, respectively. Proven/probable invasive fungal infection was identified in 5 patients (2.5%) of the EAT group and 1 patient (0.5%) of DET group, which fulfilled the predetermined criteria of non-inferiority of the DET group. Regarding the pathogens, the EAT group included 1 case of candidemia and 4 cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and the DET group included one fusariosis. The survival rate of the EAT and DET group was 98.0% vs. 98.6% at day 42 and 96.4% vs. 96.2% at day 84, respectively. During the observation period, 31 patients died due to disease progression (n=19), infection (n=5) or other causes (n=7). Causes of infection related mortality included Pseudomonas aerginosa infection (n=2), fusariosis (n=1), toxoplasmosis (n=1) and septic shock by unknown pathogen (n=1). The frequency of micafungin use was significantly lower in the DET group than the EAT group (32.5% vs. 60.2%, P<0.001). Similar results were obtained in per-protocol set analyses. Conclusions: DET successfully reduced the use of antifungal agents without increasing invasive fungal infection or mortality compared to EAT. This randomized controlled study revealed the feasibility of DET in high-risk neutropenic patients.
