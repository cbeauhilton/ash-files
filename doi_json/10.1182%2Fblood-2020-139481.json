    "abstract_text": "Background: Large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGLL) is one type of chronic lymphocytic proliferative disorders, which commonly manifests as infiltration of large granular lymphocytes in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. LGLL now includes two entities with similar clinical course, treatment strategy and outcomes: T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia and chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells. The standard therapy for LGLL is still elusive. Here, we presented the efficacy and safety of combinatorial oral immunoregulatory regimen thalidomide, prednisone, and methotrexate (TPM regimen) in a prospective phase 2 clinical trial. Methods: We designed this phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical trial (NCT04453345) to evaluate the clinical response and safety of the combination of thalidomide, prednisone, and methotrexate in symptomatic treatment na\u00efve LGLL patients. The TPM regimen includes thalidomide 50-100mg per night, prednisone 0.5-1.0mg/kg qod and methotrexate 10mg/m 2 per week. This regimen will be administrated for up to 12 months until disease progression or intolerable. Then, thalidomide maintenance will continue for another year or until intolerance. Meanwhile, we set Cyclosporin A (CsA) alone or plus steroids as control. Treatment dosage for CsA was 3-5mg/Kg/day with or without steroids (prednisone) 0.5-1 mg/Kg/day. The primary endpoint of this study was the complete response rate. Results: From Aug 2013, to Jan 2020, twenty-eight patients were enrolled in this study. The median follow-up time was 26 months (range: 7-96). Twenty-five patients (89%) achieved hematologic and symptomatic response. Among them, 21 patients (75%) achieved complete response (CR) and four patients achieved partial response. The median time to best clinical response was 6 months (2-18). The 3-years progression-free-survival (PFS) rate was 90%, and 3-years overall survival (OS) rate was 92%. The median PFS time was not reached in TPM group. The curative effect was better for TPM treatment group, both for overall response (OR) (TPM 89% (25/28) vs CsA 49% (49/99), P =0.000) and CR (TPM 75% (21/28) vs CsA 20% (20/99), P =0.000). Adverse events were uncommon, two patients had grade 1-2 nausea and one had grade 3 nausea. Two patients had grade 1-2 constipation and one patient experienced grade 1-2 peripheral neuritis. Conclusion: The efficacy of this TPM regimen is higher than the history reports with limited adverse events. The multiple-center clinical trial has been initiated to validate this conclusion.
