    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3539 Poster Board III-476 Pentostatin has been utilized clinically in combination with irradiation for host conditioning prior to reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT); however, murine models utilizing pentostatin to facilitate engraftment across fully MHC-disparate barriers have not been developed. To address this deficit in murine modeling, we first compared the immunosuppressive and immunodepleting effects of pentostatin (P) plus cyclophosphamide (C) to a regimen of fludarabine (F) plus (C) that we previously described. Cohorts of mice (n=5-10) received a three-day regimen consisting of P alone (1 mg/kg/d), F alone (100 mg/kg/d), C alone (50 mg/kg/d), or combination PC or FC. Combination PC or FC were each more effective at depleting and suppressing splenic T cells than either agent alone (depletion was quantified by flow cytometry; suppression was quantified by cytokine secretion after co-stimulation). The PC and FC regimens were similar in terms of yielding only modest myeloid suppression. However, the PC regimen was more potent in terms of depleting host CD4 + T cells (p<0.01) and CD8 + T cells (p<0.01), and suppressing their function (cytokine values are pg/ml/0.5\u00d710 6 cells/ml; all comparisons p<0.05) with respect to capacity to secrete IFN-g (13\u00b15 vs. 48\u00b112), IL-2 (59\u00b144 vs. 258\u00b132), IL-4 (34\u00b110 vs. 104\u00b112), and IL-10 (15\u00b13 vs. 34\u00b15). Next, we evaluated whether T cells harvested from PC-treated and FC-treated hosts were also differentially immune suppressed in terms of capacity to mediate an alloreactive host-versus-graft rejection response ( HVGR) in vivo when transferred to a secondary host. BALB/c hosts were lethally irradiated (1050 cGy; day -2), reconstituted with host-type T cells from PC- or FC-treated recipients (day -1; 0.1 \u00d7 10 6 T cells transferred), and challenged with fully allogeneic transplant (B6 donor bone marrow, 10 \u00d7 10 6 cells; day 0). In vivo HVGR was quantified on day 7 post-BMT by cytokine capture flow cytometry: absolute number of host CD4 + T cells secreting IFN-g in an allospecific manner was ([x 10 6 /spleen]) 0.02 \u00b1 0.008 in recipients of PC-treated T cells and 1.55 \u00b1 0.39 in recipients of FC-treated cells (p<0.001). Similar results were obtained for allospecific host CD8 + T cells (p<0.001). Our second objective was to characterize the host immune barrier for engraftment after PC treatment. BALB/c mice were treated for 3 days with PC and transplanted with TCD B6 bone marrow. Surprisingly, such PC-treated recipients developed alloreactive T cells in vivo and ultimately rejected the graft. Because the PC-treated hosts were heavily immune depleted at the time of transplantation, we reasoned that failure to engraft might be due to host immune T cell reconstitution after PC therapy. In an experiment performed to characterize the duration of PC-induced immune depletion and suppression, we found that although immune depletion was prolonged, immune suppression was relatively transient. To develop a more immune suppressive regimen, we extended the C therapy to 14 days (50 mg/Kg) and provided a longer interval of pentostatin therapy (administered on days 1, 4, 8, and 12). This 14-day PC regimen yielded CD4 + and CD8 + T cell depletion similar to recipients of a lethal dose of TBI, more durable immune depletion, but again failed to achieve durable immune suppression, therefore resulting in HVGR and ultimate graft rejection. Finally, through intensification of C therapy (to 100 mg/Kg for 14 days), we were identified a PC regimen that was both highly immune depleting and achieved prolonged immune suppression, as defined by host inability to recover T cell IFN-g secretion for a full 14-day period after completion of PC therapy. Finally, our third objective was to determine with this optimized PC regimen might permit the engraftment of MHC disparate, TCD murine allografts. Indeed, using a BALB/c-into-B6 model, we found that mixed chimerism was achieved by day 30 and remained relatively stable through day 90 post-transplant (percent donor chimerism at days 30, 60, and 90 post-transplant were 28 \u00b1 8, 23 \u00b1 9, and 21 \u00b1 7 percent, respectively). At day 90, mixed chimerism in myeloid, T, and B cell subsets was observed in the blood, spleen, and bone marrow compartments. Pentostatin therefore synergizes with cyclophosphamide to deplete, suppress, and limit immune reconstitution of host T cells, thereby allowing engraftment of T cell-depleted allografts across MHC barriers.
