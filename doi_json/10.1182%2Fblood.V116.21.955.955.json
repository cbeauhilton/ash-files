    "abstract_text": "Abstract 955 Innate T cells display features of Ag-experienced T cells (e.g., high levels of CD44) before any encounter with non-self antigens. They include NKT cells, CD8\u03b1/\u03b1 T cells, as well as an undefined (and presumably very small) proportion of nai\u0308ve CD4 and CD8 \u03b1/\u03b2 T cells. We used the RAG2-GFP transgenic mouse model to differentiate nai\u0308ve innate single-positive thymocytes (GFP + CD44 high ) from re-circulating effector/memory T cells (GFP - CD44 high ) T cells and nai\u0308ve conventional (GFP + CD44 low ) thymocytes. We found that innate T cells represent about 10% of TCR\u03b1\u03b2 + single-positive GFP + thymocytes. To evaluate their proliferative ability under lymphopenic conditions, conventional and innate T cells were sorted and injected in TCR\u03b2KO mice. Four weeks later, expansion of conventional T cells was 2.3-fold greater than that of innate T cells. Comprehensive phenotypic analyses of GFP + CD8+CD44 low vs GFP + CD8+CD44 hi thymocytes revealed that B7-H1 was absent on conventional thymocytes but constitutively expressed on innate CD8 + thymocytes. Moreover, in vitro stimulation of innate T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies induced a strong proliferation and secretion of inflammatory mediators such as interferon (IFN)-gamma. The addition of anti-B7-H1 neutralizing antibody, however, inhibited proliferation and IFN-gamma production in a dose-dependent manner. To see whether B7-H1 ligation influenced the viability of CD8 + thymocytes, GFP + CD8+CD44 low and GFP + CD8+CD44 hi thymocytes were treated for 48 hrs with anti-B7-H1 antibody in vitro then stained for annexin-V and propidium iodine. Under these conditions, 70% of innate GFP + CD8 + CD44 hi T cells underwent apoptosis as opposed to 30% with conventional thymocytes. To test their bystander properties, we added conventional or innate T cells as third-party cells to an in vitro antigen stimulation assay. Briefly, B6 peritoneal macrophages pulsed with recombinant chicken ovalbumin (rOVA) presented OVA-derived peptides in the context of MHCI, and served as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). For responder cells, we added naive T cells from T cell receptor-transgenic OTI mice that recognize OVA. Interestingly, innate thymocytes were capable of promoting the activation of responding T cells; an effect that was lost upon treatment of innate CD8 T-cells with anti-B7-H1 neutralizing antibody. The sum of these data suggests a role for B7-H1 in the development, survival and proliferation of innate \u03b1/\u03b2 T cells. Acknowledgments Moutih Rafei holds a Fellowship from the CIHR.
