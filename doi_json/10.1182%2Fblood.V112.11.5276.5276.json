    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown a correlation between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCBL) prognosis and molecular features using genome profiles by cDNA microarrays. Later reports have shown that immunohistochemical tests using markers as CD10, bcl-6 and MUM-1 to identify germinal center B-cell (GCB) and non-GCB patterns can have a similar value and are gaining major importance in assessing prognosis in patients with DLBCL. Gastric DLCBL is the most frequent extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma. AIM: To evaluate the frequency of GCB and non-GCB subgroups in primary gastric DLCBL and the impact of these tests in prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients older than 18 years with a diagnosis of primary gastric DLBCL were identified in a single institution from January 2002 to December 2005 and included in this analysis. Immunohistochemical stains were performed using antibodies against CD20, CD10, bcl-6 and MUM1 in all cases. Survival curves were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were included in this study. The median age at diagnosis was 68 years (range 40 to 86 years). Thirteen male and 16 female patients were included. All cases received chemotherapy with CHOP regimen. Cases were subclassified in GCB and non-GCB using CD10, bcl-6, and MUM1 expression. Four cases (14%) were considered GCB and 25 cases (86%) non-GCB. There were no statistical differences between both groups in the following variables: age, ECOG performance status, serum LDH levels, clinical stage and International Prognostic Index (IPI) score. No statistical difference in survival was observed between the GCB and non-GCB groups. The 3-year overall survival for the entire group was 30%. CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemical expression of non-GCB pattern is very frequent in primary gastric DLBCL in Peru. However, it does not show an effect in survival, probably related to the small number of cases included in the present study."
