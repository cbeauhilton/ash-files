As a consequence, the role of upfront autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (ASCT) has become more controversial. The ECOG E4A03 clinical trial randomized newly diagnosed MM patients to lenalidomide with high-dose dexamethasone (LD) vs lenalidomide with low-dose dexamethasone (Ld) (Rajkumar et al Lancet Oncol 2010; 11: 29\u201337). Upon completing four cycles of therapy, pts had the option of ASCT or continuing on the assigned therapy. The purpose of this abstract is to determine the outcome of patients on this trial pursuing early ASCT according to various age-groups. MATERIALS and METHODS: This is a post hoc, retrospective analysis of overall survival within age subgroups stratified by early ASCT status. This is a landmark analysis including only pts surviving the first 4 cycles of therapy. RESULTS: In all three age-groups studied, 1, 2, and 3-year survival probability estimates with ASCT were excellent ( Tables 1 , 2 , and 3 ). For patients under the age of 65 who survived the first 4 cycles of therapy, overall survival at 3-years was 94% with early ASCT, 78% in pts continuing protocol therapy. Although direct comparison with patients not going to early transplant is not possible because the assignment to early ASCT versus no early ASCT was not randomized, survival with ASCT at 3-years appeared higher. While we attempt to correct for age, the differences may be influenced by other factors such as performance status, comorbidities, response to therapy, etc. The presumption that treatment related mortality (TRM) should be more problematic for older pts undergoing ASCT is addressed by looking at the >65 and >70yo cohorts. In the >65 age group, one-year mortality is similar between the early ASCT population and the no early ASCT population. In the >70 age group, no adverse impact of early ASCT was seen in the first year on overall survival but the sample size is extremely small. In all age groups early ASCT seemed to mitigate some of the survival disadvantage associated with randomization to the LD arm. Table 1.

The risk of early mortality was notably low in the first year in all age groups. The risk of early mortality seems to increase at 2 years for the LD pts not choosing early ASCT and at 3 years for the Ld pts not choosing early ASCT. Selection bias makes it difficult to compare results for pts that chose early ASCT directly to the patients who did not receive early ASCT in this trial. As such, these results emphasize the need for randomized trials investigating the timing of ASCT in myeloma in the era of novel therapy.
