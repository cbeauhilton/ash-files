    "abstract_text": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a model system for the role of aberrant transcription in cancer, and differentiation therapy in cancer treatment. APL is characterized by accumulation of abnormal promyelocytes in patient bone marrow, and by reciprocal chromosomal translocations involving retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR \u03b1). RAR\u03b1 heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR\u03b1) and regulates transcription of genes associated with myeloid differentiation, in response to all trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Though PML-RAR\u03b1 is the most prevalent fusion gene in APL, four variant fusion genes (X-RAR\u03b1) are currently known. By understanding the role that each fusion gene plays in APL, we may better understand the mechanism of this leukemia, and, by extension, the role of aberrant transcription factors and transcriptional regulation in cancer. Several lines of evidence suggest that X-RAR\u03b1 interact with and delocalize RXR\u03b1. We previously characterized the phenotype of the hCG-NuMA-RAR \u03b1 transgenic model (Sukhai et al , Oncogene, 2004). We observed that mice developed a myeloproliferative disease-like myeloid leukemia with promyelocytic features, with a variable onset peripheral blood phenotype (2\u201317 months). To further elucidate the role of RXR\u03b1 in APL, we conditionally knocked out RXR \u03b1 in hCG-NuMA-RAR \u03b1 mice. Phenotype analysis of NuMA-RAR\u03b1 + mice was consistent with our previous results; animals developed a myeloproliferative disease-like myeloid leukemia within 4 months of birth. Hemizygous and homozygous RXR\u03b1 conditional knockout mice were phenotypically normal as late as 12 months of age. The leukemic phenotype in NuMA-RAR\u03b1 + mice was dependent on the presence of functional RXR\u03b1, as indicated by a progressive decrease in accumulation of promyelocytes, as well as Gr-1 + , CD11b + , CD13 + and CD117 + cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of NuMA-RAR\u03b1 + mice hemizygous and homozygous for the RXR\u03b1 mutation, as compared to NuMA-RAR\u03b1 + RXR\u03b1 +/+ controls. We further observed that downstream target genes (e.g., C/EBP\u03b1) of NuMA-RAR\u03b1 were regulated in an RXR\u03b1-dependent manner, as these genes exhibited the greatest extent of deregulation in the presence of both alleles of functional RXR\u03b1, but had progressively less deregulated expression with loss of one or two functional alleles of RXR\u03b1. Furthermore, the NuMA-RAR\u03b1/RXR\u03b1 heterodimer was observed to bind to retinoic acid response elements in vitro . Strikingly, these observations mirrored what we observed in single transgenic mice with low vs. high transgene copy number. Mice with low copy number exhibited nuclear localization of the NuMA-RAR\u03b1/RXR\u03b1 complex, the greatest extent of deregulation of gene expression, and a rapid-onset phenotype. On the other hand, mice with high transgene copy number exhibited cytoplasmic localization of NuMA-RAR\u03b1/RXR\u03b1, the least extent of gene deregulation, and an ameliorated leukemia similar to that observed in NuMA-RAR\u03b1 mice carrying the conditional mutation in RXR\u03b1. We therefore propose that NuMA-RAR\u03b1 cooperates with RXRa in the development of leukemia in hCG-NuMA-RAR \u03b1 transgenic mice, and that the localization of this complex to the nucleus is required for leukemogenesis in transgenic mice.",
