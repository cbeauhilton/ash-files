    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5124 Here, we report the preliminary results of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Haplo-HSCT) with G-CSF mobilized bone marrow grafts without T cell depletion for 10 cases with refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma accompanied by bone marrow involvement. The patients were aged ranging 7 to 38 years and six were of T- and four were B-cell origin at diagnosis. Eight patients received a conditioning regimen consisting of high-doses of cytarabine and cyclophosphamide with total body irradiation, while two cases busulfan, thiotepa and cyclophosphamide. All patients had rapid engraftment with the mean time for neutrophil and platelet recovery was 16.6 days and 19.2 days, respectively. Three cases died within six months after transplantation from severe acute graft-versus-host disease, fungal infection or relapse. The others are currently alive at a median follow-up of 60.7 months (range: 44-81months). Therefore, haplo-HSCT might provide an opportunity of myeloablative therapy for refractory lymphoma with bone marrow involvement. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
