    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-16 The Human Genome Project's completion of the human genome sequence in 2003 was a landmark scientific achievement of historic significance. It also signified a critical transition for the field of genomics, as the new foundation of genomic knowledge started to be used in powerful ways by researchers and clinicians to tackle increasingly complex problems in biomedicine. To exploit the opportunities provided by the human genome sequence and to ensure the productive growth of genomics as one of the most vital biomedical disciplines of the 21 st century, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) is pursuing a broad vision for genomics research beyond the Human Genome Project. This vision includes facilitating and supporting the highest-priority research areas that interconnect genomics to biology, to health, and to society.Current efforts in genomics research are focused on using genomic data, technologies, and insights to acquire a deeper understanding of biology and to uncover the genetic basis of human disease. Some of the most profound advances are being catalyzed by revolutionary new DNA sequencing technologies; these methods are already producing prodigious amounts of DNA sequence data, including from large numbers of individual patients. Such a capability, coupled with better associations between genetic diseases and specific regions of the human genome, are accelerating our understanding of the genetic basis for complex genetic disorders and for drug response. Together, these developments will usher in the era of genomic medicine. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
