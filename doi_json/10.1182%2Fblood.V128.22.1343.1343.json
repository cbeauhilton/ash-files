    "abstract_text": "Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a causative agent of a malignant disease of peripheral CD4+ T cells called adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) and several inflammatory diseases such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Although major target of HTLV-1 is CD4+ T cells, other hematopoietic cells such as CD8+ T cells and monocytes are also infected with HTLV-1. Since the receptors of HTLV-1 are glucose transporter 1 and neuropilin 1, which are found on various cell surfaces, it is possible that HTLV-1 infects various hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, the previous studies could not detect HTLV-1 in HSCs. To assess the distribution of infected cells and expression of viral genes in various tissues, a nonhuman primate model, Japanese macaques (JMs) infected with simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1) was utilized in this study. STLV-1 is a close relative of HTLV-1, and the dynamics of viral replication and proliferation of infected cells are very similar to each other. Indeed, STLV-1 caused malignant lymphomas in STLV-1 infected monkeys. Therefore, STLV-1 infected JMs are good models of HTLV-1 carriers. Using this model, we first analyzed transcription level of two viral genes, tax and STLV-1 bZIP factor , in multiple tissues, and found that tax was highly expressed in bone marrow compared to other tissues. Since Tax is a potent activator of viral transcription, this result suggested that viral replication occurred in bone marrow. To evaluate which cells express Tax in bone marrow, we performed flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow mononuclear cells from STLV-1 infected monkeys, and found that not only CD4+ T cells but also non T cells (CD3 negative cells) expressed Tax. To determine whether hematopoietic stem cells are infected with HTLV-1, we next performed highthroughput sequencing of HTLV-1 integration sites in multiple cell lineages using a next generation sequencer. Since HTLV-1 is randomly integrated into genome of infected cells, and each infected cell can proliferate clonally, we can interpret that cells sharing same integration sites are derived from the same precursor cell. Blood samples from patients with HAM/TSP were separated into five cell types: CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. Integration sites of HTLV-1 provirus were analyzed by next generation sequencing using different chips for each cell type in order to avoid cross contamination between the samples. The results showed that some of these cells have same integration sites between different cell types. More than 40 percent of HTLV-1 infected B cells, monocytes and neutrophils had shared the same integration sites, suggesting that HSCs in the HAM/TSP patients were infected with HTLV-1. Importantly, most HTLV-1 infected CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells had independent integration sites, while some of them shared the same integration sites with non T cell subsets. These results implied that most T-cell clones were generated by de novo infection in the periphery, but a part of infected T cells were derived from infected HSCs. To assess whether HTLV-1 infected HSCs persist in vivo, we again analyzed integration sites in neutrophils from the same HAM/TSP patients after 1 year. About 50 percent of integration sites in HTLV-1 infected neutrophils were detected after 1 year. Considering short lifespan of neutrophils, this result suggests that HTLV-1 infected HSCs could be maintained for at least 1 year in vivo. To visualize HTLV-1 infection in myeloid cells, we performed immunofluorescence staining of neutrophils from HAM/TSP patients. Tax and myeloperoxidase were detected in neutrophils. Finally, we evaluated the significance of infected monocytes in viral transmission. We isolated monocytes from HAM/TSP patients and co-cultured with JET WT35 cell, which is a subline of Jurkat containing a fluorescent reporter of viral infection. The result demonstrated that monocyte from HAM/TSP patients could be a source of infective HTLV-1. In conclusion, our findings suggest that HSCs infected with HTLV-1 survive for long time in vivo, and could be reservoirs of the virus. Since ATL is a difficult disease to cure, further studies are required to understand the nature of HTLV-1 infection. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
