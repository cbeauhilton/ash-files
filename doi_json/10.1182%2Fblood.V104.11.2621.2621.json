    "abstract_text": "Platelets are a rich source of latent TGF-\u03b21, a cytokine with potent profibrotic and immunomodulatory effects, yet little is known about how platelet TGF-\u03b21 becomes activated. Current theory is that TGF-\u03b21 (a 25 kD disulfide-bonded homodimer produced by furin cleavage of a conjoint LAP-TGF-\u03b21 precursor) must dissociate from the LAP (a 80 kD disulfide-bonded homodimer) to be active. Methods : Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), whole blood, or 5x10 8 washed platelets in HEPES-buffered modified Tyrode\u2019s buffer with 1 mM each Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ , was placed in an aggregometer cuvette at 37\u00b0C with thrombin (0.125 U/ml) or TRAP (10 \u03bcM) for 2 h. Samples were then centrifuged and both the pellet and the supernatants were analyzed. TGF-\u03b21 levels were quantified by: (1) Quantikine TGF-\u03b21 assays in which recombinant TGF-\u03b2 receptor-II is used to capture active TGF-\u03b21. Active TGF-\u03b21 was measured in untreated samples while total TGF-\u03b21 was measured by converting latent TGF-\u03b21 to active by acidification, (2) Mink lung epithelial cell (MLEC) assay in which active TGF-\u03b21 binding results in expression of a luciferase reporter gene fused to a truncated PAI-1 promoter. Samples were incubated with MLECs overnight and cell lysates were assessed for luciferase activity. Non-reduced and reduced samples were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies to TGF-\u03b21, LAP (present in large latent complexes [LLCs] and small latent complexes [SLCs]), and LTBP-1 (present in LLCs). Results: Latent TGF-\u03b21 was maximally released within 5 minutes after platelet stimulation with thrombin (130 \u00b1 15 ng/ml, n=9), whereas TGF-\u03b21 activity increased slowly and progressively, reaching approximately 1% of total TGF-\u03b21 at 2 hours (1.44 \u00b1 0.69 ng/ml, n=14). A polyclonal antibody reported to be specific for active TGF-\u03b21 reacted with a 25 kD band in nonreduced samples at all time points (5-120 mins) as expected, since SDS dissociates TGF-\u03b21 from LAP in both SLCs and LLCs. There was also, however, an unexpected time-dependent increase in the binding of this antibody to several closely spaced bands of ~110 kD and ~260 kD representing SLCs and LLCs, respectively. Antibodies to LAP also reacted with the ~110 and ~260 kD bands. Reduced samples immunoblotted with the LAP antibody demonstrated a prominent band at 40 kD at all time points representing the LAP monomer. Preincubation of platelets with reagents that inhibit thiol-disulfide exchange reduced the peak generation of active TGF-\u03b21 by 62\u201381%: bacitracin (165 \u00b1 71 pg/ml vs. control, 848 \u00b1 448 pg/ml, n=8, p=0.005), CMPS (781 \u00b1 362 pg/ml vs. 2060 \u00b1 420 pg/ml, n=5, p=0.01), DTNB (570 \u00b1 140 pg/ml vs. 1810 \u00b1 222 pg/ml; n=3, p=0.005). A maleimide/biotin probe (BMCC) demonstrated time-dependent incorporation into SLCs and LLCs. Chromatography of 2 h platelet supernatants using Superdex-200 demonstrated that high molecular weight fractions containing LLCs had TGF-\u03b21 activity on Quantikine assays (n=4). Conclusions: 1) Inhibitors of thiol-disulfide exchange inhibit the activation of platelet TGF-\u03b21, (2) Molecular species containing TGF-\u03b21 covalently attached to LAP or other proteins via disulfide bonds appear in the platelet supernatant over time, (3) TGF-\u03b21 activity can be detected in high molecular weight species. Our data suggest that thiol-disulfide exchange may contribute to TGF-\u03b21 activation; this mechanism may have implications for TGF-\u03b2 activation in other cells.",
