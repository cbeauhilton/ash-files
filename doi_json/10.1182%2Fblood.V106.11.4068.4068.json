    "abstract_text": "The prevention of bleeding by prophylaxis regimen particularly for joint rehabilitation, could be considered a more effective treatment for hemophilia patients. In hemophiliacs with factor VIII inhibitor (F VIII inh) prophylaxis is not generally proposed because the bypassing agents for these patients may be less effective than F VIII concentrates. We report the regimen and results of a 6 months rFVIIa (Recombinant factor VIIa) prophylaxis, in a young hemophilia A patient (4 years old), with F VIII inh and immune tolerance induction (ITI) treatment and compared, with rFVIIa, the on demand treatment results for the 6 months prior to prophylaxis. After 2 years of a high dose regimen ITI, the FVIII inh titer was less than 50 BU and the immune tolerance treatment remains on going. Due to the development of a right knee target joint the rFVIIa prophylaxis was decided as an active rehabilitation approach to prevent the development of chronic arthropathy as well as to improve the quality of life of the child. During the 6 months period, prior to the initiation of rFVIIa prophylaxis 22 bleeds occurred i.e., 9 right knee hemarthrosis and 13 other joint bleedings and hematoma including elbow, wrist, ankle, foot, arm and chest. These bleeds were all treated with rFVIIa with a dose ranging from 100 to 200 \u03bcg/kg depending on the severity of the episodes and the duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 8 days. After 6 recurrent right knee hemarthrosis, a lavage of the joint was performed and prophylaxis with rFVIIa was subsequently initiated. A 120 \u03bcg/kg rFVIIa injection was performed 3 times a week concomitantly with the ITI treatment infusion and just before the physiotherapy course. During the 6 months of prophylaxis regimen we observed 9 bleeds with 3 major post traumatic bleedings which were treated by one 200 \u03bcg/kg/day rFVIIa injection which was resolved in one to three days. This prophylaxis treatment was effective for the arthropathy evolution and permitted the patient to return to school on a regular basis compared to the previous year. The total dose of on demand rFVIIa treatment used before prophylaxis was 458 mg/6 months. This amount decreased by 25% during the six months of prophylaxis with rFVIIa to reach 343 mg. The results of this significant observation led us to conclude that rFVIIa could be effectively used as prophylactic treatment in patients with FVIII inh and administered safely via a portacath device even in cases of high doses, as demonstrated in this young patient. This prevention approach resulted in a decrease of bleeding episodes, injections, and a significant improvement in the quality of life.",
