    "abstract_text": "Background and Rationale: BAY 94-9027 (damoctocog alfa pegol) is a site-specifically PEGylated B-domain deleted recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) with an extended half-life, approved for prophylaxis or treatment of bleeds in previously treated patients (PTPs) aged \u226512 with hemophilia A. The efficacy and safety of BAY 94-9027 was demonstrated in two phase II/III clinical studies in PTPs with severe hemophilia A, however, real-world data are still being gathered. The aim of the HEM-POWR study is to assess the effectiveness and long-term safety of BAY 94-9027 in the real-world clinical setting. Patients will be introduced to an online patient portal that provides study information as well as access to eDiaries and electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) to patients to facilitate retention over the duration of the study. Patients will also be given the opportunity to participate in LIFE-ACTIVE, a sub-study analyzing the relationship between the patients' regular daily activity and the efficacy parameters collected during HEM-POWR. Here we present the features of the patient portal and describe the LIFE-ACTIVE sub-study design. Study Design and Methods: HEM-POWR (NCT03932201) is a multinational, multicenter, non-interventional, open-label, prospective, phase IV, cohort study. It aims to enroll \u2265200 PTPs with hemophilia A receiving BAY 94-9027 (on-demand, prophylaxis, or intermittent prophylaxis [as per local label]). Key exclusion criteria are presence or history of FVIII inhibitor (\u22650.6 Bethesda units), diagnosis of any bleeding or coagulation disorder other than hemophilia A, or treatment with immune tolerance induction at enrollment. The primary objective of HEM-POWR is to assess the effectiveness of prophylaxis with BAY 94-9027 in the real-world setting through the collection of total bleeding events and analysis of annualized bleeding rate. Secondary objectives include long-term safety, joint health, location and number of target joints, hemostasis during surgery and PROs. Patient enrollment, adherence and retention can be difficult in observational hemophilia studies. The patient portal for this study aims to overcome these challenges by providing study- and product-related information. It also aims to lessen the burden for patients in the study by providing e-solutions to collect their study data, including the ability to complete the study diary, and PRO measures online. The portal also includes videos explaining the study and study procedures, and is country-customized with links to relevant websites. Patients participating in LIFE-ACTIVE will be asked to wear an ActiGraph CP Insight activity-tracking smart watch continually for four 30-day periods, at their initial visit and then at months 12, 24 and 36. Measurements recorded will include physical activity intensity and duration, general mobility, and sleep quality and duration. All data will be transferred to a secure, cloud-based system and patients will not be aware of the values measured by the device. Participating countries include, but may not be limited to Austria, Belgium/Luxemburg, Canada, Colombia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, and USA. The study will run from 2019 until 2025, with an observation period of \u226560 months.
