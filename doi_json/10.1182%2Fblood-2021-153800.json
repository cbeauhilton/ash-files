    "abstract_text": "Elucidating the stepwise differentiation processes that leads from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells to mature effector cells is critical for understanding both normal and neoplastic hematopoiesis. Early studies suggested that common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) are oligo-lineage hematopoietic progenitors that produce all lineages of myeloid cells, including granulocytes, monocytes, erythrocytes and megakaryocytes. CMPs do so by first giving rise to megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), two types of bi-lineage progenitors. However, this concept was challenged by several recent studies where single cell techniques demonstrated that CMPs, GMPs and MEPs are highly heterogenic. The existence of lineage-restricted subsets within the CMP population leads to questions about whether erythroid and megakaryocytic lineage commitment is actually initiated at the multipotent progenitor or CMP stage. During the past 15 years, several lineage-restricted subsets of progenitors have been separated out from CMP population, including monocyte-dendritic progenitors, megakaryocyte progenitors, and erythroid progenitors based on expression of CD115/Flt3, CD41/CD150, and CD105/CD150, respectively. However, the remaining CMP population is still highly heterogenic. Thus, further separation of functional subsets within the CMP compartment is required. By screening cell surface markers that can further separate CMPs, we have identified CD27 as a reliable marker to separate all megakaryocyte/erythrocyte-committed progenitors from granulocyte/monocyte-committed progenitors. In addition, we found that CD62L is only expressed on granulocyte/monocyte-committed progenitors. CD27 and CD62L co-staining can separate CMP into CD27 + CD62L + , CD27 + CD62L - and CD27 - CD62L - subsets. Biology and morphology study showed that CD27 + CD62L - cells are closely associated with GMPs, whereas CD27 - CD62L - cells are closely associated with MEPs. In vitro culture and in vivo transplantation functional studies demonstrated that 1) CD27 + CD62L + cells are pre-GMPs that give rise to FcGRII/III + GMPs and only produce granulocytes and monocytes; 2) CD27 - CD62L - cells are pre-MEPs that give rise to MEPs and primarily produce erythrocytes and megakaryocytes with minimal contribution to granulocytes and monocytes; 3) CD27 + CD62L - subset enriches cells with genuine CMP potential capable of producing GMPs, MEPs, and subsequent progeny. Taken together, we have identified two novel populations of committed progenitors that serve as intermediates between CMP-GMP and CMP-MEP commitment pathways. Identification of pre-GMPs and pre-MEPs fills in the gap between CMPs-GMPs and CMPs-MEPs, supporting the hierarchal relationship of myeloid lineage differentiation.
