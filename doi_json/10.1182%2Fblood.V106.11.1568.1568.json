    "abstract_text": "Introduction Multiple myeloma is a clonal plasma cell malignancy characterized by proliferation and accumulation of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Most patients are incurable with the current treatment modalities. Clearly novel agents are needed to improve the outcome for patients with myeloma. We have previously shown that the combination of bortezomib and tipifarnib results in synergistic myeloma cell death. This increase in apoptosis is associated with down regulation of phosphorylated AKT, a potent anti-apoptotic signaling molecule. Therefore, agents that target AKT represent ideal compounds for further study in myeloma. Perifosine is a novel, oral bioavailable alkylphospholipid. Perifosine has displayed apoptotic and antipropliferative activity in vitro and in vivo in several human cancer models including leukemia. Perifosine exerts its actions by interfering with key intracellular pathways including AKT, MAPK, JNK, p21 waf1 . Our hypothesis is that targeting AKT via multiple upstream pathways will result in increased myeloma cell apoptosis. Therefore, we assessed the effects of single agent perifosine with and without tipifarnib on multiple myeloma cell lines. Method The myeloma cell line RPMI8226 was used. Cell viability and proliferation were assessed using MTT assays. Cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of both agents alone and in combination. Cell proliferation was assayed at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Western blots were then carried out to evaluate the effects of the intracellular protein PDK1, one of the critical signaling molecules that phosphorylates and activates AKT. Results As we and others have previously shown, tipifarnib at concentrations that can be achieved clinically is associated with minimal cytotoxicity. At 5 \u03bcM, tipifarnib decrease proliferation by only 20%. In contrast, there is a potent dose response effect of single agent perifosine (Fig. 1). These results were apparent as early as 24 hours. When tipifarnib at 5 \u03bcM is used in combination with a subtherapeutic dose of perifosine (2 \u03bcM), there is a marked decrease in cell proliferation (Fig. 2). In addition, combination therapy resulted in a reduction in the phosphorylated form of PDK1, a critical finding that was not seen with either drug alone. Conclusion Combination therapy with tipifarnib and perifosine results in less cell proliferation compared to either agent used alone in the RPMI8226 myeloma cell line. The dosages employed in these in-vitro studies are lower than those used in previously published data and are clinically achievable. Studies targeting other cell lines including MM.1R, MM.1S, and U266 are in progress. Analysis of AKT, Caspase 3, 8 and 9 are being explored to help delineate the mechanism of this novel combination. The goal is to develop further effective treatment options for patients with myeloma.
