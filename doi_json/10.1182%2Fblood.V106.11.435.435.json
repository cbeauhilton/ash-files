    "article_date": "November 16, 2005",
    "session_type": "Oral Sessions",
    "abstract_text": "Using denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography and sequencing, we screened for ABL KD mutations 319 IM-resistant Ph+ pts. Median time between diagnosis and IM start at 400\u2013600 mg/d was 40 (0\u2013160) months. Median duration of IM was 27 (9\u201362) months. Evaluable pts were 256/319 (80%). At the time of analysis, 178/256 (70%) pts were in chronic phase (CP)(36 previously untreated, 142 post-IFN failure), 16 (6%) pts were in accelerated phase (AP), 26 (10%) pts were in myeloid blast crisis (myBC), 36 (14%) were in lymphoid blast crisis (lyBC) or had Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). One hundred and forty-two pts had primary resistance to IM, 114 had acquired resistance. Ninety-eight mutations were found in 91/256 (36%) pts. In 6 pts (2 Ph+ ALL, 2myBC, 1 lyBC, 1 CP post-IFN failure) multiple mutations simultaneously occurred. Mutations mapped to 15 codons, the most frequent ones being E255K/V (15 pts), Y253F/H (12 pts), T315I (10 pts), M351T (10 pts), F359V/I (10 pts), M244V (9 pts), G250E (8 pts). Three novel amino acid substitutions (F311I; E355D; F359I) and a novel mutated codon (P296H) were detected; biochemical/structural characterization will be presented. Mutations were found in 36/178 (26%) CP pts (4/36 (11%) previously untreated, 32/142 (22%) post-IFN failure), 7/16 (44%) AP pts, 19/26 (73%) myBC pts and 29/36 (81%) lyBC/Ph+ ALL pts (CP vs. AP, p=.04; AP vs. BC, p=.01; CP vs. BC, pAP>CP); b) there is a significantly higher probability of mutations in pts with acquired resistance vs. pts with primary resistance; c) mutations, and in particular those affecting P-loop or codon 315, are associated with a worse outcome.
