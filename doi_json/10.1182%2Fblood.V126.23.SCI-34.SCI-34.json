    "abstract_text": "In spite of an explosion of data regarding mutations associated with childhood ALL, to date these key genetic changes rarely have been the driver of therapy. Clinical parameters at presentation (WBC, age, T- vs. B-lineage, etc.) have dictated initial risk stratification and induction approaches, followed by risk-adapted therapy based upon leukemic response measured by minimal residual disease (MRD, either PCR- or flow cytometry-based). With minor variations, rapid disappearance of peripheral MRD, followed by significant clearance from the marrow after induction, and most importantly, the level of MRD after consolidation have allowed clear distinctions in outcomes that have driven intensification or de-intensification of therapy resulting in improved outcomes. Although specific gene mutations have been associated with risk, MRD has further identified better risk patients within genetic subgroups. For patients noted to be very high risk who are candidates for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the presence of MRD both pre- and post-transplant has been associated with increased risk of relapse; the risk being modified by level of MRD, whether or not GVHD occurs after HCT, and timing after HCT when MRD is measured. In lower risk patients being treated with chemotherapy and higher risk patients eligible for HCT, more sensitive approaches to flow cytometry and PCR, as well as next-generation sequencing (NGS) MRD approaches (sensitive to 1/10^7 cells) are currently being tested. It is not clear yet whether NGS-MRD offers substantial improvements in patients treated with chemotherapy, as broad-based testing is underway; the latest comparative outcomes will be presented. There is evidence of a striking improvement in our ability to define patients who will do very will after transplant (not relapse), and preliminary evidence that post-HCT NGS MRD testing is more sensitive that other methodologies in defining risk of relapse after transplant. As the latest information about the ability of different approaches to MRD is shown in this session, we will also present how response to therapy based upon MRD interacts with various genetic subtypes (Ph+ ALL, extreme hypodiploidy, etc.). Even in subclasses that are considered very high risk based solely upon genetics, measurement of MRD can define higher and lower risk groups. Going forward, as more and different types of patients are subcategorized and treated with targeted agents based upon specific mutations, it is likely MRD response will continue to be important in mapping intensity of approach and defining children at highest risk of relapse who might benefit from HCT or other cellular therapeutic approaches.
