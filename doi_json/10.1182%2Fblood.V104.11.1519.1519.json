    "abstract_text": "Background : Controversy persists regarding diagnostic accuracy as well as added value for quantitative assessment of neutrophil PRV-1 expression in polycythemia vera ( Klippel et al. Blood  2003 ; 102 : 3569 ; Tefferi et al. Blood  2004 ; 103 : 3547 ). This is partly because of limited data regarding the relationship between neutrophil PRV-1 transcript level and other laboratory parameters in polycythemia vera (PV). More information is also needed on the PRV-1 expression profile in other myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), including essential thrombocythemia (ET) and agnogenic (AMM), post-polycythemic (PPMM), and post-thrombocythemic (PTMM) myeloid metaplasia. Methods : The current prospective study involves 141 subjects, including 49 with PV, 40 with secondary or spurious polycythemia (SP), 23 with ET, 11 with AMM, 4 with PPMM, 3 with PTMM, and 11 normal controls. Peripheral blood neutrophil PRV-1 expression was quantified by real-time PCR according to published methods ( Klippel et al. Blood 2003) . The results were first compared among the different disease categories and controls. Subsequently, within the specific disease categories of both PV and ET, PRV-1 expression was correlated with several laboratory [leukocyte count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score (LAP) score, CD34 count, platelet count, hematocrit, serum EPO level, MCV, serum ferritin, reticulin fibrosis] and clinical (age, sex, disease duration, spleen size, thrombosis history, and presence of treatment with cytoreductive agent, aspirin, or phlebotomy) parameters. Results : The incidence of increased neutrophil PRV-1 expression was the highest in PV and PPMM (p<0.0001) while the results in the other disease categories (ET, SP, AMM, PTMM) were similar among each other and controls ( p=0.89).

In addition, in PV, univariate analysis revealed significant correlations between PRV-1 expression and leukocyte count, ANC, and reticulin fibrosis. On multivariate analysis, only LAP score retained its significance.

The study also underscores the suboptimal diagnostic accuracy of the neutophil PRV-1 assay in distinguishing PV from SP. Most importantly, the demonstrated tight correlation between PRV-1 transcript level and LAP score raises the issue of added value to currently available diagnostic tests."
