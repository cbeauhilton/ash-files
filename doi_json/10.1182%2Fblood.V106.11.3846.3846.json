    "abstract_text": "We generated the first transplantable adult mouse models of beta-thalassemia intermedia and major by infusing mouse hematopoietic-fetal-liver cells (HFLC) heterozygous or homozygous for a deletion of the beta-globin gene (respectively with th3/+ and th3/th3 cells) into lethally irradiated congenic C57BL/6 mice. Six to 8 weeks post transplantation, mice transplanted with th3/+ HFLCs show 7 to 9 g/dL of hemoglobin levels, splenomegaly, abnormal red cells and increased iron overload. Mice transplanted with th3/th3 HFLCs, unless blood transfused, die 8 to 10 weeks after engraftment showing profound anemia, massive splenomegaly and very rapid and dramatic iron overload. For this reason, we began a systematic study to compare iron content and the expression level of iron related genes in normal and thalassemic mice of varying ages and sex in different organs (liver, duodenum, spleen, kidney and heart). In liver, we observed that iron content increases proportionally with the level of anemia, age and if the blood transfusion is included. We are currently analyzing the other organs. The expression of hepcidin, ferroportin, Hfe, ferritin, transferrin, transferrin-receptor 1 and 2, ceruloplasmin, divalent metal transporter 1 and hemojuvelin are being tested also in all these organs. In particular, we observed that hepcidin is dramatically downregulated in liver of beta-thalassemic animals. Our hypothesis is that low expression of this gene leads to high iron content in these animals. We intend to demonstrate that administration or increasing hepcidin levels of this peptide can prevent iron absorption in beta-thalassemia. We developed two alternative strategies to test our hypothesis. In the first one, we synthesized the active form of the mouse hepcidin peptide that will be administered intraperitoneally to mice affected by beta-thalassemia. In the second, lentiviral vectors have been generated in order to constitutively secrete hepcidin in the bloodstream of animals affected by beta-thalassemia. These vectors were introduced into hematopoietic stem cells derived from mouse embryos of normal and mice affected by beta-thalassemia and engrafted in myeolablated normal mice. The engrafted mice express hepcidin 6 weeks post transplantation by RT PCR. These animals, along with the animals in which hepcidin will be administrated intraperitoneally, will be analyzed at the endpoint of the experiment (> 4 months) for their hematological values and iron content to see if the use of hepcidin can be used to prevent excessive iron absorption in beta-thalassemia.",
