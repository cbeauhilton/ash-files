    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4963 Overall survival (OS) is significantly improved by 5-azacitidine in intermediate-2 (int-2) and high risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with 10\u201329% marrow blasts, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with 20\u201330% marrow blasts, compared with conventional treatments, and currently appears as the standard of care, at least in patients who are not candidates to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of 5-azacitidine in 25 patients treated at our institution from 2009 to 2012, outside of clinical trial. Our series was composed by 17 cases of MDS with IPSS risk int-2 or high, 6 AML with marrow blasts between 20% and 30% and 2 CMML. Patients were treated with 5-azacitidine at a dosage of 75 mg/m 2 /d subcutaneously for 7 days every 28 days (schedule 5 day on, 2 day off and 2 day on). Median age of our cohort was 72 years (range 37\u201381 y), male to female ratio was 0. 6 and the median number of cycles received was 7 (range 1\u201326). According to the MDS-specific comorbidity index 9 pts (53%) were classified as low-risk, 7 pts (41%) as intermediate risk and 1 pt (6%) as high risk. Seventeen (68%) patients (13 MDS, 3 AML, 1 CMML) who had received at least 4 cycles of therapy were evaluable. Median age of these 17 patients was 71 years (range 37\u201381 y), male to female ratio was 0. 8 and median number of cycles administered was 8 (range 4\u201326). The overall response rate (ORR) was 59% (10/17 patients). According to International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria, five patients (29%) reached complete remission (CR) after a median of 5 cycles of therapy (range 4\u20136), two patients (12%) obtained hematologic improvement with bone marrow complete remission (marrow CR) after 6 and 11 cycles of therapy respectively, three patients (18%) showed hematologic improvement (HI) after 5 cycles (range 4\u20136), while stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) were observed in 4 (23%) and in 3 patients (18%) respectively after 5 cycles (range 4\u20137). Median duration of response was 12 months (range 6\u201326 mo); median overall survival from the beginning of 5-azacitidine, for all patients treated, was 14. 4 months (range 7\u201333 mo). We did not observe any differences in response rate according to age, bone marrow fibrosis, cytogenetics and transfusion requirements. In the responder group (10 patients) we did not observe grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity after a median observation time of 10 months (range 5\u201333 mo). Among non-responding patients, four (57%) recurred to hospitalization due to infectious or hemorrhagic complications (median observation time 15 months, range 7\u201333). 5-azacitidine confirmed to be an active therapy for patients with int-2 and high risk MDS and AML with low marrow blast counts not candidate to high intensity treatment for age and or comorbidities, showing high response rate and good tolerability. The low rate of serious adverse events and need of hospitalization improved patient's quality of life and reduced the utilization of medical resources.
