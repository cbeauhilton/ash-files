    "abstract_text": "Lifelong maintenance of the blood system requires equilibrium between clearance of damaged hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and long-term survival of the HSC pool. Perturbations of cellular homeostasis such as nutrient deprivation, irradiation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress can result in HSC loss. However, HSCs must survive low-level stressors in order to sustain lifelong replenishment of the hematopoietic system. It is poorly understood how human HSCs balance apoptosis with survival in the context of basal stress, and how adaptive signalling is regulated in leukemia stem cells (LSCs). The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is an adaptive pathway that can protect cells against stressors such as ROS, nutrient deprivation and misfolded proteins. To assess the expression levels of key ISR pathway components, we analyzed the proteome of purified human HSCs and progenitor cells from cord blood (CB). Quantitative label-free mass spectrometry revealed lower expression of eIF2\u03b1, eIF2\u03b2 and eIF2\u03b3 subunits in HSCs compared to downstream progenitors. Furthermore, activated-transcription factor 4 ( ATF4) mRNA is highly expressed in HSCs compared to progenitors. Similar to our findings in normal CB cells, analysis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples revealed lower protein levels of eIF2\u03b1, eIF2\u03b2 and eIF2\u03b3 in phenotypically primitive (CD34 + CD38 - ) compared to differentiated (CD34 + CD38 + ) AML cell populations. These results suggest that primitive cells in normal hematopoiesis and AML are primed for ISR activation.To assess ISR activity in human HSPCs, we used an ATF4 lentiviral reporter (ATF4 rep ) that measures ISR-induced ATF4 translation. We subjected ATF4 rep -transduced CD34 + CB cells to hypoxia and amino acid deprivation, and found that valine depletion strongly induced ATF4 rep activity. ATF4 rep upregulation was abolished in the presence of an eIF2\u03b1 S52A mutant that cannot be phosphorylated. Furthermore, knockdown of eIF2\u03b1, eIF2\u03b2 or eIF2\u03b3 subunits in CD34 + CB cells increased ATF4 rep activity. Thus, low levels of eIF2\u03b1, eIF2\u03b2 or eIF2\u03b3 result in efficient ATF4 translation, and nutrient deprivation upregulates ATF4 through eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. We assessed the effect of ATF4 upregulation on CB cell proliferation and survival. Following knockdown of ATF4 mRNA in CD34 + CB cells, the cells were incubated in valine deficient media to induce translational upregulation of ATF4. Valine depletion of shCTRL-transduced cells for 2 days did not affect proliferation or apoptosis, as measured by EdU incorporation or Annexin-V. In contrast, valine depletion of shATF4-transduced cells resulted in decreased proliferation (2-fold, P = 0.0004) and increased apoptosis (4-fold, P < 0.0001,). Thus, ATF4 promotes survival of primitive CD34 + CB cells undergoing valine depletion.We performed in vivo xenograft studies to examine the ISR activity in the best available setting to approximate homeostatic conditions for human HSPCs. Transplantation of ATF4 rep -transduced CB cells showed that human HSPCs in the mouse bone marrow maintained a 2.4-fold higher ATF4 rep activity compared to downstream progenitors ( P = 0.0002). ATF4 rep activity further declined in mature monocytes, granulocytes and B-cells (13-fold, P < 0.0001). To determine if high ISR activity is associated with improved HSC function, we transplanted lin - CB cells expressing high ATF4 rep activity (GFP-high) and low ATF4 rep activity (GFP-low) into mice. The level of engraftment as well as the number of engrafted mice was increased from GFP-high cells compared to GFP-low cells ( P = 0.001). The hierarchical structure of normal hematopoiesis is partially maintained in AML. We evaluated ATF4 rep expression in the malignant hierarchy and found that 4/5 patient samples had higher ATF4 rep expression in CD34 + cells compared to CD34 - cells. Furthermore, serial transplantation of ATF4 rep -transduced cells showed higher engraftment from GFP-high compared to GFP-low cells ( P < 0.0001). Thus, primary human AML cells that possess high ISR activity are enriched for LSC function.Our data establish that the adaptive ISR pathway plays a key role in maintaining homeostasis of normal and malignant stem cells. We show that Amino acid deprivation activates the ISR in human HSPCs resulting in ATF4-dependent pro-survival signals. In an unperturbed state, HSCs are in a state of primed ISR activity, mechanistically maintained by eIF2 scarcity and high ATF4 levels. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
