    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1427 Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are a class of emerging epigenetic therapies which are being used to treat cancer. Two HDACi (vorinostat and romidepsin) are FDA approved for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. HDACi have been employed in clinical trials for acute leukemia, but single agent activity has been limited. Improved efficacy is observed when combined with other anticancer agents. In the current study we addressed acute leukemia models using vorinostat, a pan-HDACi that inhibits HDAC class I, II, and IV and entinostat, a newer HDACi that inhibits HDAC class I more specifically. These HDACi were combined with inhibition of another histone modifying enzyme: lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). The LSD1 gene encodes a favin-dependent monoamine oxidase, which demethylates mono- and di-methylated lysines, specifically lysines 4 and 9 on histone 3 (H3K4 and H3K9), thus it is also involved in gene regulation through post-translational histone modification. LSD1 overexpression has been linked to human carcinogenesis in bladder carcinomas, lung cancer, and poorly differentiated neuroblastoma. However, it has not been studied in hematologic malignancies. Because LSD1 is structurally similar to monoamine oxidase (MAO), it has been shown that nonselective MAO inhibitors also inhibit LSD1. Here we employed tranylcypromine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOi), as an irreversible LSD1 inhibitor. Recently published work from our laboratory has shown synergistic effects of combined HDAC and LSD1 inhibition in brain tumors (glioblastoma multiforme). Similar results have been published in breast cancer cells, but no work has been done in hematological malignancies. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible synergy of HDAC and LSD1 inhibitors in acute leukemia cells. LSD1 protein expression in several leukemia cells lines was analyzed by Western blot analysis. LSD1 was expressed in all leukemia cell lines tested, which included T-cell ALL (Jurkat, Sub-T1, MOLT4), B-cell ALL (JM-1,697), and Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL (Z33, Z119, Z181). To determine whether synergy exists between HDACi and LSD1 inhibitors, Jurkat cells were exposed to different concentrations of tranylcypromine and vorinostat or entinostat. After 24 hr, DNA fragmentation was assessed by propidium iodide (PI) staining followed by flow cytometric analysis. A combination index (CI) less than 1.0 is representative of synergism as measured by Calcusyn software. Results showed a synergistic effect on DNA fragmentation when combining the 2.5 \u03bcM dose of vorinostat with a range of tranylcypromine doses (1 mM CI= 0.78, 1.5 mM CI= 0.49, and 2 mM CI= 0.39). The same effect was observed with the combination of 2.5 \u03bcM entinostat with 2 mM tranylcypromine (CI=0.52). Viability studies performed with the same drug concentrations in conbination also showed statistically significant cell death. Additional acute leukemia cell lines, 697 and MOLT-4, also demonstrated significantly increased cell death with the combination relative to treatment with either agent alone. Since these agents inhibit histone deacetylation and lysine demethylation, we tested whether these histone modifications were promoted by combination treatment. Jurkat cell lysates were generated by acid extraction of histones and Western blot analysis was conducted. We demonstrated that in fact histone acetylation was increased with combination treatment, indicating that these modifications coordinately regulate each other in acute leukemia cells. A molecular target for LSD1 is p53, a tumor suppressor protein whose activity is regulated by lysine methylation and demethylation. Western blot analysis showed that p53 is downregulated in leukemia cells after exposure to the combination of HDAC and LSD1 inhibitors. Future studies will address if p53 downregulation is a trigger for the synergistic cell death. Taken together, our data shows the efficacy of combining LSD1 inhibitors with HDAC inhibitors in multiple acute leukemia models. Since tranylcypromine is also a FDA-approved agent, these results urge the design of a feasible and effective clinical trial combining LSD1 and HDAC inhibitors for acute leukemia.
