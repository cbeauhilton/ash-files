    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2205 Background and Objective: The fibronectin isoform containing the alternatively-spliced extra domain A (EDA + -FN) is normally absent from the circulation, but plasma levels of EDA + -FN can become markedly elevated in several pathological conditions including atherosclerosis. It remains unclear in humans whether these elevated levels of EDA + -FN are actively contributing to disease pathogenesis, or rather simply serving as a marker associated with vascular stress and/or injury. Several in vitro studies suggest that EDA + -FN can activate toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an innate immune receptor that triggers pro-inflammatory responses We hypothesize that presence of EDA + -FN in plasma promotes inflammation and accelerates atherosclerotic plaque formation. Model and Method: We generated EDA +/+ /ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice, which contain optimized spliced sites at both splicing junctions of the EDA exon and constitutively express only EDA + -FN, and EDA \u2212/\u2212 /ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice, which contain an EDA-null allele of the EDA exon and express only FN lacking EDA. ApoE \u2212/\u2212 , EDA +/+ /ApoE \u2212/\u2212 and EDA \u2212/\u2212 /ApoE \u2212/\u2212 were fed a high-fat Western diet (21% fat and 0.2% cholesterol) beginning at 6 weeks until they were sacrificed at 5 months of age (i.e., 14 weeks on high-fat Western diet). We compared the extent of atherosclerosis in whole aortae, stained with Oil Red O and en face lesion area measured by morphometry, and in the cross section area of the aortic sinus using the VerHoeffs/Van Gieson stain. Results: We report that atherosclerotic plaque (% of total aorta) formation in the aorta of EDA +/+ /ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice was increased by two-fold compared to control ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice ( P <0.0001). Deletion of the alternatively spliced EDA domain in the ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice (EDA \u2212/\u2212 /ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in the aorta ( P <0.05) compared to ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. Total cholesterol and triglycerides levels were similar in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 , EDA +/+ /ApoE \u2212/\u2212 and EDA \u2212/\u2212 /ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. Similarly, atherosclerotic plaque formation was significantly increased in the aortic sinus of EDA +/+ /ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice, intermediate in control ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice and reduced in EDA \u2212/\u2212 /ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice ( P <0.05). Additionally, we found that macrophage content, as analyzed by immunohistochemistry, was significantly elevated in the aortic root lesions of EDA +/+ /ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice and reduced in EDA \u2212/\u2212 /ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice ( P <0.05). Moreover, EDA + -FN did not affect the sex-dependent regulation of atherosclerosis in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. Future experiments using EDA +/+ /ApoE \u2212/\u2212 /TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 are under progress to determine whether EDA +- FN exacerbate atherosclerosis via upregulating TLR4 signaling. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that EDA + -FN is pro-inflammatory and promotes atherosclerotic lesion formation and that monitoring plasma EDA + -FN might have prognostic value in patients at high risk for atherosclerosis.
