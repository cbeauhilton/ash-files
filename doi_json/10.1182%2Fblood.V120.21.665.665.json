    "abstract_text": "Abstract 665 Improved treatment outcomes for HR-ALL are associated with a significant risk of symptomatic ON, particularly in adolescents. Causes are multifactorial, including exposure to DEX, MTX and ASNase. This was first noted on CCG-1882 (1991\u20131995), which showed more ON in slow early responders (SER) given 2 vs 1 interim maintenance/delayed intensification (IM/DI) phases as part of therapy that included C-MTX/ASNase during IM and continuous DEX (d1-21) during DI (Mattano, JCO 2000). Since 1996 the COG has prospectively monitored the occurrence of symptomatic ON in HR ALL trials. CCG-1961 (1996\u20132002) showed that alternate-week DEX (AWD) (d1-7, 15\u201321) during 2 DIs reduced ON compared with continuous DEX during 1 DI in rapid early responders (RER) (Mattano, Lancet Oncol 2012). AALL0232 (2003\u20132011) enrolled a total of 3154 HR-ALL patients (pts) 1\u201330 yr and included COG augmented therapy with a 2\u00d72 randomization to DEX (10 mg/M2 d1-14) vs PDN (60 mg/M2 d1-28) during induction (IND) and HD-MTX vs escalating-dose C-MTX plus pegaspargase during IM. RER pts received 1 IM/DI, SER pts received 2 IM/DI; all initially received monthly DEX maintenance (MTC) pulses (6 mg/M2 d1-5). To limit ON, pts 13+ yr received AWD during 1 or 2 DI, while pts  hip > ankle. In conclusion, DEX is associated with a higher incidence of ON among pts 10+ yr receiving augmented therapy. Children 1\u20139 yr appear to tolerate DEX and PDN during IND with similar low ON rates. ON risk can be significantly reduced by using AWD during DI, and by using HD-MTX rather than C-MTX/ASNase with PDN based regimens. Studies are presently underway that include prospective MRI screening to further define the natural history of ON in HR ALL and to identify additional risk factors for this common toxicity.
