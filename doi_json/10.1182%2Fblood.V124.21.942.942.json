    "abstract_text": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been reported to be highly expressed in AML1-ETO-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML1-ETO-positive AML), and we found it correlate with extramedullary infiltration regulated of by APP/ERK/MMP-2 signal pathway in our previous study. It is also known that C-KIT mutations highly expressed in AML1-ETO-positive AML and cooperates with full-length AML1-ETO to induce AML in mice. In this study we further described a close correlation of APP gene with C-KIT mutations, as well as APP related clinical and prognostic significance in 65 patients with AML1-ETO-positive AML. 65 cases of AML1-ETO-positive AML patients with median age of 30 years old, who were admitted to our hospital from February, 2006 to June, 2013 and made the diagnosis according to WHO2008 diagnosis standard, were enrolled into this study. APP expression in bone marrow cells before the first chemotherapy was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase (QRT)-PCR method. These cases were accordingly divided into APP-H group (n=33, with high level of APP by QRT-PCR) and APP-L group (n=32, with lower level of APP by QRT-PCR) according to median APP expression. Incidence of C-KIT mutations, clinical characteristics and prognosis including complete response (CR), overall survival (OS), and recurrence free survival (RFS) with median 35 (6-96) months followed-up was differentiated between the two groups. Furthermore , expression of APP and AML1/ETO fusion gene were simultaneously monitored at the time of 3, 6, 12 and 24 months or relapse after CR by QRT-PCR method. The incidence of C-KIT mutations was significantly increased in the APP-H group, as compared with the APP-L group (39.4% versus 12.5%) and it was positively correlative with APP expression (r p =0.435, P=0.004). Of the 17 patients harboring C-KIT mutations, 13 patients overexpressed APP gene (P=0.014) ( Figure 1 ). Clinically, APP-H patients exhibited significantly elevated white blood cells count, increased extramedullary infiltration (P=0.039 and P=0.019, respectively). Moreover, APP overexpression was related to low rate of two-cycle CR, RFS and OS (P=0.020, P=0.001 and P=0.029, respectively) (Table 1). In addition, the change of APP expression was consistent with that of AML1-ETO fusion gene monitored by QRT-PCR method at different status of leukemia, though APP expressed differently in different patients with the same AML1-ETO expression. Taken together, these data suggest that APP gene is correlated with C-KIT mutations and indicates poor disease outcome and dynamic monitoring APP expression could be another choice of minimal residual disease monitoring in AML1-ETO-positive AML.
