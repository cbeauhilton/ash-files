    "abstract_text": "Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that function in cell-cell communication by trafficking protein and RNA species to bystander cells. While exosomes are produced by all cell types, those released by cancer cells have come to the forefront of investigation for their potential to modulate the tumorigenic niche. We recently reported that exosomes released from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells impact the phenotype and function of stromal and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) found in the bone marrow (Huan et al. Cancer Res. 2013). As part of these studies, we observed a decrease in clonogenic potential of murine HSPCs exposed to exosomes isolated from the Molm-14 AML cell line in vitro and in xenograft transplantation studies. To determine if this observation was more widely applicable, we next exposed murine c-kit-selected HSPCs to exosomes isolated from both primary patient samples and the HL-60 AML cell line in vitro . Strikingly, exposure to primary AML patient and HL-60 exosomes produced a significant reduction in colony formation; on average, only 7.3% as many colonies formed in exposed conditions compared to controls. We also previously showed that exosomes traffic a complex mixture of protein and RNA to bystander cells. A recent report demonstrated increased DNA damage in mammary epithelial cells due to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) following exposure to exosomes derived from multiple breast cancer cell lines (Dutta et al. PLOS One 2014). A similar mechanism has been shown to restrict the replicative capacity of human HSPCs. Here, we hypothesized that exosome transfer might elicit a DNA damage response in murine HSPCs, contributing to the decreased ability of exposed cells to form colonies. When we performed 48 hours of in vitro HL-60 exosome exposure of c-kit enriched progenitor cells, we found a statistically significant upregulation of genes involved in DNA damage sensing as well as homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathways compared to unexposed controls. Immunofluorescence analysis on exosome-exposed cells also revealed an increase in the formation of \u03b3H2AX foci in cells exposed to HL-60 exosomes, indicating an increase in DNA damage burden. Next, we tested if increased ROS might account for DNA damage and the resulting progenitor frequency. Using a flow cytometric analysis of ROS (DCF-DA) revealed a clear upward shift in median fluorescence intensity of exosome-treated c-kit+ cells compared to untreated controls. To further confirm the involvement of ROS, we treated exosome-exposed cells with the antioxidant NAC. While this did not result in a substantial reduction in ROS levels as measured by flow cytometry, analysis of the transcriptional DNA damage response revealed a dose-response pharmacological rescue of HR and NHEJ pathway gene expression. Our work in aggregate suggests that AML exosomes have a direct suppressive effect on HSPCs that involves, at least in part, gains in ROS that promote DNA damage accumulation and genomic instability. We propose a model whereby the paracrine trafficking of exosomes plays an active role in the erosion of HSPC activity in the AML niche that leads to characteristic cytopenias even at low leukemic burden.
