    "abstract_text": "Gene mutations play a critical role in leukemogenesis of AML1-ETO-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AE-AML). Nevertheless, gene mutation profile in this subtype leukemia remains unclear, and their clinical effect might be underestimated. In this study, we detested gene mutations at diagnosis and relapse with next-generation sequencing in 64 newly diagnosed AE-AML patients, and verified the results with Sanger sequencing at the same time. Our results showed that 68.8% patients presented recurrent mutations at diagnosis and 6/11 cases underwent genetic alterations at relapse. C-KIT mutation was the most common event at diagnosis, with an incidence of 42.2%, followed by ASXL1 (15.6%), MET (12.5%), MLH1 (9.4%) , TET2 (7.8%), and FBXW7, TP53 and DNMT3A (7.8%), etc. Also, C-KIT mutation was the most common molecular event associated with relapse (7/11, 63.6%). No significant difference in the clinical characteristic between the gene mutation and wild type (WT) groups was observed, except of higher incidence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACAs) (P=0.025) in TP53 mutation patients. C-KIT (exon 8, 17) mutation but not exon 10 adversely affected on survival. Also ASXL1 and TP53 mutation were poor for the RFS (P<0.05), and ASXL1, MET, FBXW7 and TP53 mutation negatively impacted on the OS (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed C-KIT (exon 8, 17) and ASXL1 mutations were the independent adverse factors for survival. Further, co-mutation of these two genes showed even worse effect on survival. Taking together, additional gene mutations are critical in the development and progression of AE-AML. C-KIT and ASXL1 mutations are the two most common molecular events in this subtype leukemia. Single mutation of C-KIT (exon 8, 17) or ASXL1 poorly affects on survival, even worse in the co-mutation. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
