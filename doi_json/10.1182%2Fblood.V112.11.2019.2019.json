    "abstract_text": "Thrombin activates protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1) faster than protease activated receptor 4 (PAR4) due to a hirudin-like sequence in the exodomain of PAR1 that binds thrombin\u2019s exosite I. However, recombinant exodomain studies indicate that PAR4 does have extended contacts with \u03b1-thrombin that influence PAR4\u2019s kinetics of cleavage. In the current report, the role of an anionic cluster (Asp 57 , Asp 59 , Glu 62 , Asp 65 ) in the exodomain of PAR4 is examined for its influence on cleavage and activation of PAR4 on cells in the absence or presence of PAR1. \u03b1-Thrombin induces wild type PAR4 (PAR4-wt) calcium flux with an EC 50 of 110 nM whereas mutation of the four anionic residues (PAR4-AAAA) increases the EC 50 to 641 nM. In contrast, PAR4-wt and PAR4-AAAA are activated by \u03b3-thrombin with a similar EC 50 (588 nM and 449 nM, respectively, p = 0.48), indicating a role for \u03b1-thrombin\u2019s exosite I in PAR4 activation. Coexpression of PAR1, lowered the EC 50 of cleavage 10 fold for both PAR4-wt from 321 to 26 nM and PAR4-AAAA from 2.2 \u03bcM to 360 nM, respectively. Individual point mutations at Asp 57 , Asp 59 , Glu 62 or Asp 65 show that PAR4-D57A is activated by \u03b1-thrombin with the same EC 50 as PAR4-wt (140 nM) whereas PAR4-D59A is the same as PAR4-AAAA (699 nM). Glu 62 and Asp 65 contribute to \u03b1-thrombin recognition, but to a lesser extent. The current report shows that PAR4 uses its anionic cluster to interact with \u03b1-thrombin and that this interaction is important even in the presence of PAR1."
