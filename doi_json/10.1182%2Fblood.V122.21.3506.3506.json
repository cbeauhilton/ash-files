    "abstract_text": "Activating \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in platelets is followed by \u03b1IIb\u03b23 clustering and \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated outside-in signaling. However, the molecular bases for the latter two processes are not well understood. It has been found that activating \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in platelets is followed by trans-autoactivation of the tyrosine kinase c-Src constitutively associated with the \u03b23 cytosolic tail. In turn, activated c-Src initiates a signaling cascade that culminates in the re-organization of the platelet cytoskeleton, platelet spreading, and fibrin clot retraction. Previously, we observed that replacing Gly708 in the \u03b23 transmembrane helix with Asn causes constitutive \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation, as well as ligand binding-independent \u03b1IIb\u03b23 clustering when the \u03b23 mutant is expressed in CHO cells. Here, we have asked whether activating \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in platelets in the absence of ligand binding is sufficient to cause c-Src activation. Exogenous peptides that interact with the membrane-embedded segments of \u03b1IIb\u03b23, such as the CHAMP (Computed Helical Anti-Membrane Protein) peptide anti-\u03b1IIb TM, cause agonist-independent activation of single \u03b1IIb\u03b23 molecules. To test whether anti-\u03b1IIb TM causes c-Src activation in the absence of ligand binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23, we suspended gel-filtered human platelets in buffer containing an inhibitory cocktail of EDTA, apyrase, and eptifibatide that completely prevents anti-\u03b1IIb TM-stimulated platelet aggregation as well as FITC-labeled fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and extracted aliquots of the stimulated platelets with 1% NP-40 in a buffer containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. c-Src was immunoprecipitated from the extracts and immunoblotted for phosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine residue 416, an indicator of c-Src activation. We found that stimulating platelets with anti-\u03b1IIb TM caused Tyr416 phosphorylation. This effect required the presence of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 because it did not occur when \u03b23-knockout mouse platelets were incubated with the peptide. Further, Tyr416 phosphorylation was prevented by the Src-family kinase inhibitor PP2, but not by the inactive analogue PP3, implying that it resulted from the trans-autophosphorylation of \u03b23-associated c-Src. Tyr416 phosphorylation was not dependent on an anti-\u03b1IIb TM-induced rearrangement of the platelet cytoskeleton because it was not inhibited by the actin polymerization inhibitors cytochalasin D and latrunculin A. Similar results were seen when immunoprecipitated \u03b23 was immunoblotted for phosphorylated Tyr416. The tyrosine kinase Syk is also associated with the \u03b23 cytosolic tail. Like c-Src, we found that incubating platelets with anti-\u03b1IIb TM caused Syk phosphorylation that was independent of ligand binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23, was catalyzed by activated c-Src because it was inhibited by PP2 but not PP3, and like c-Src trans-autophosphorylation, was unaffected by cytochalasin D and latrunculin A. By contrast, we found that anti-\u03b1IIb TM-induced \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation was not sufficient to cause phosphorylation of FAK when ligand binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was prevented by EDTA, apyrase, and eptifibatide. Anti-\u03b1IIb TM-induced c-Src activation in the absence of ligand binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 implies that the peptide causes ligand-binding-independent \u03b1IIb\u03b23 clustering. To demonstrate that this is the case, we incubated suspended CHO cells expressing wild-type \u03b1IIb\u03b23 with anti-\u03b1IIb TM, fixed the cells with formalin, and stained the cells with the FITC-labeled \u03b1IIb\u03b23-specific monoclonal antibody A2A9. Like CHO cells expressing \u03b23 Gly708Asn, the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 of CHO cells incubated with anti-\u03b1IIb TM was present in patches distributed over the cell surface, consistent with the formation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 clusters. By contrast, in the absence of anti-\u03b1IIb TM, \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was present in a homogenous ring at the CHO cell periphery. These studies demonstrate that the CHAMP peptide anti-\u03b1IIb TM can activate \u03b23-associated c-Src and Syk under conditions to preclude ligand binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23. This indicates that activation of individual \u03b1IIb\u03b23 molecules can initiate \u03b1IIb\u03b23 oligomerization in the absence of ligand binding and cytoskeletal reorganization. Thus, these studies suggest that not only is resting \u03b1IIb\u03b23 poised to undergo a conformational change that exposes its ligand binding site, but it is poised to rapidly assemble into intracellular signal-generating complexes as well.
