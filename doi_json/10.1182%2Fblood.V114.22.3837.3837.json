    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3837 Poster Board III-773 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that remains incurable despite the use of conventional chemotherapy. Recent advances in the field of cell biology could lead to new therapeutic agents based upon molecular targeting, such as thalidomide and proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. These agents have remarkable activity against both newly diagnosed and refractory patients with MM, but prolonged exposure to them may result in the development of de novo drug resistance. Thus, it is necessary to identify and validate novel agents with less toxicity to overcome drug resistance and to improve the clinical outcome of MM. Progression and chemoresistance are thought to involve IL-6, whose expression is induced by NF-\u03baB, through its regulation of the growth and survival of MM cells. IL-6 leads to constitutive activation of STAT3, which in turn results in the expression of high levels of Mcl-1. Thus, the constitutive activation of both NF-\u03baB and STAT3 plays an important role in MM cell proliferation, and both molecules are important targets for the treatment of MM. Auranofin (AF: RIDAURA\u00ae; GSK) is a coordinated gold compound that has been widely used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis based on its anti-inflammatory properties through the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation. Therefore, assuming that AF has the potency to induce apoptosis in MM cells by interfering with NF-\u03baB and STAT pathways, it may become a candidate for a novel therapeutic agent. To address our hypothesis, the effects of AF on inducing apoptosis of various MM cells were examined. Further, the molecular mechanism of AF-induced apoptosis in MM cells was investigated. AF inhibited the growth of U266 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner with IC50 of 50 nM at 24 h. AF significantly induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and subsequent apoptosis of U266 cells. AF-induced apoptosis in various human MM cell lines and CD138-positive plasma cells from patients with MM involved the activation of caspases-3, -8, and -9. Treatment with AF inhibited the constitutive and IL-6-induced activation of STAT3, and then downregulated the expression of Mcl-1 but not that of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL proteins. To clarify the biological significance of Mcl-1 in AF-induced apoptosis of MM cells, Mcl-1 expression vector (pEGFP-hmcl-1) and control vector were introduced into U266 cells (designated as U266/mcl and U266/neo cells). Induction of apoptosis by AF was abrogated in U266/mcl, but not in U266/neo cells. We next examined the effect of AF on the DNA binding activity of STAT3. Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay (EMSA) using U266 nuclear extracts demonstrated that IL-6-induced STAT3 binding activity was inhibited by the presence of AF. These results suggest that AF inhibits the IL-6-induced JAK/STAT pathway selectively and induces apoptosis in MM cells via the downregulation of Mcl-1. In addition, AF downregulated the activation of NF-\u03baB in an I\u03baB-independent manner, and also inhibited DNA binding activity in U266 cells. Although NF-\u03baB inhibitory peptide (SN-50) did not directly induce the expression of Mcl-1, the combination of SN-50 with AF reduced the levels of Mcl-1, suggesting that inhibition of NF-\u03baB potentiates the apoptotic effect of AF. Finally, our in vitro data prompted us to examine whether or not the effects of AF are equally valid in a clinical settings. The protocol for assessing the clinical benefit of oral administration of AF (RIDAURA\u00ae) in patients with relapsed or refractory MM was approved by the Ethics Committee of Saitama Medical University. Since 2008, 7 patients with refractory MM were treated with oral RIDAURA\u00ae 6 mg daily. The median follow-up for patients was 7.5 months. All 7 patients responded to AF, including one PR (partial response) and 6 SD (stable disease) with no progression. No adverse events have been observed to date. Details of the clinical outcome will be presented. In conclusion, gold compound AF inhibited constitutive activation of both STAT3 and NF-\u03baB, resulting in the downregulation of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein in MM cells with clinical relevance. A low pharmacological concentration (50 nM) of AF is widely employed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis without any side effects; therefore, it may be used to treat MM without the risk of severe toxicity. We propose that AF (RIDAURA\u00ae) may have potential use as a new molecular-targeted agent for the treatment of MM. Disclosures: Off Label Use: Auranofin in the treatment of multiple myeloma."
