    "abstract_text": "The integrin heterodimer \u03b1IIb\u03b23 resides on the platelet surface in an equilibrium between inactive (low affinity) and active (high affinity) conformations. We have reported that the transmembrane (TM) domains of its \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 subunits engage in specific heteromeric and homomeric interactions that define the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation state. Further, we have proposed a \u201cpush-pull\u201d hypothesis to explain how \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activity is regulated. Thus, processes that disrupt the TM domain heterodimer stabilize the active \u03b1IIb\u03b23 conformation and \u201cpush\u201d the low affinity/high affinity equilibrium toward the activated state. Conversely, interactions that either require separation of the TM domains or are more favorable when the TM domains are apart \u201cpull\u201d the equilibrium in the same direction. Moreover, as would be predicted by this hypothesis, we found that adding a soluble peptide corresponding to the \u03b23 TM domain to suspensions of gel-filtered platelets induced signaling-independent, \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated platelet aggregation, confirming that disruption of the \u03b1IIb/\u03b23 TM domain heterodimer activates \u03b1IIb\u03b23. To identify the motifs responsible for oligomerization of the \u03b23 TM domain, we used the TOXCAT assay. In TOXCAT, a chimeric protein consisting of an N-terminal ToxR\u2019 DNA binding domain, a C-terminal maltose-binding protein domain, and an interposed \u03b23 TM domain was expressed in the inner membrane of E. coli. TM domain-mediated dimerization of the chimeric protein then drove the transcriptional activation of a reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT). We replaced each residue in the \u03b23 TM domain with either Leu, Ala, Val or Ile and measured the effect on CAT synthesis. The results were then used to calculate a perturbation index that reflects the mean fold-change in observed CAT activity for each of the mutants. When analyzed in this way, TOXCAT revealed that \u03b23 helices associate homomerically with a 4 residue periodicity and that the interactive side of the helix lies along residues 700, 704, 708, and 712. Next, based on the TOXCAT results, we introduced selected mutations into the \u03b23 TM domain of full-length \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and measured their effect on FITC-fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 expressed in CHO cells. We found that the disruptive mutations M701L, I704L, L705L, L712A, and L713A, located on the interactive side of the \u03b23 helix, induced constitutive fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23, whereas mutation of the intervening residues did not. Lastly, the TOXCAT and fibrinogen binding results were applied to a model of the \u03b23 TM helix, revealing that the residues involved in oligomerization of the \u03b23 TM domain were present as a \u201csticky\u201d stripe along one face of the helix. Our results indicate that the face of the \u03b23 helix that mediates its homomeric interaction also mediates its interaction with the \u03b1IIb TM domain; that mutations at this interface disrupt both homomeric and heteromeric interactions, and that these mutations strongly induce fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Thus, our findings indicate that disruption of the \u03b1/\u03b2 TM domain interface alone is sufficient to activate \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and that homomeric \u03b23 interactions by themselves are not required to induce fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23."
