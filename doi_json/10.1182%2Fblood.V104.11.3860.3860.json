    "abstract_text": "Background : Classic reports on lymphocyte development hold that B and T cells develop independently. This concept derives in part from the observation that patients with pure B cell immunodeficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia have a normal thymus and T cell numbers. Our recent findings however challenge this concept. We found that T cell development depends not only on the interaction of T cell precursors with thymic epithelial cells but also on other cells. Here we report that those other cells are B cells. Aims : The purpose of this study was to determine whether B cells drive T cell development and TCR diversification in the thymus. Methods : We compared the number of sub-populations of thymocytes and TCR repertoire diversity in B-cell deficient and B-cell proficient mice and in B cell deficient mice following immunoglobulin (Ig) injections. Total leucocytes numbers were determined with a Coulter counter and numbers of thymocytes sub-populations were calculated by flow cytometry analysis. TCR repertoire diversity was measured by a novel method based on hybridization of TCR V\u03b2 specific cRNA on a gene chip platform. Results : In B-cell deficient mice the number of thymocytes was four times reduced and TCR V\u03b2 chain diversity was up to one million times lower compared with wild type mice. Numbers and diversity were restored by treatment of the mice with gamma globulin (see table). Conclusions : T cell development and diversification is driven by B cells.  Mice .
