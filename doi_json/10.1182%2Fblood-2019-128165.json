    "abstract_text": "CMML is a lethal myeloid neoplasm with no therapies that improve its dismal prognosis. Inhibition of BET family members has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy based on preclinical data identifying BRD4 as a therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia. However, despite potent on-target transcriptional remodeling, early phase clinical trials have demonstrated only modest activity secondary to a variety of resistance mechanisms. In ovarian cancer BET inhibitor (BETi) treated cells, compensatory upregulation and addiction to pro-survival kinase networks have been observed. Given that over 50% of CMML cases have mutations upregulating kinase signaling, we hypothesized that BETi resistance is mediated by these networks in CMML and can be targeted therapeutically. We tested this hypothesis by performing a limited screen of kinase inhibitors alone and in combination with the IC 20 of the BETi INCB54329 in 8 human leukemia cell lines. This screen revealed that the IC 50 of the PIM inhibitor (PIMi) INCB53914 decreased after co-treatment with BETi in a majority of the leukemia cell lines tested. Synergy was validated chemically in U937, TF1 and SKM1 leukemia cells using other selective inhibitors of BET and PIM. We next assessed the activity of the BET-PIM combination in 14-day colony formation assays with 10 unique CMML bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNCs) patient samples(Fig. 1A). These studies revealed that combination therapy significantly suppressed clonogenicity versus BMNCs treated with vehicle or single drug alone. Finally, this synergy was validated in vivo in 36 patient derived xenografts (PDX) from 3 CMML patients, as manifest by reduced leukemic burden/engraftment in CMML PDX treated with combination therapy(Fig. 1B). To explore the mechanism by which BETi and PIMi therapeutically synergize we treated U937 and SKM1 leukemia cells with INCB54329 and measured mRNA and protein levels for all PIM isoforms. Surprisingly, we identified that PIM1 was increased following treatment with INCB54329, other BETi, or a JQ1-derived PROTAC (Fig. 1C). PIM1 upregulation was also manifest in INCB54329 persistor U937 leukemia cells generated by daily BETi treatment for 6 weeks. Testing across a broader panel of leukemia cell lines revealed an inverse correlation between PIM1 induction and decrease in the IC 50 of PIMi following BETi treatment, suggesting PIM1 upregulation confers sensitivity to combination therapy. Consistent with this, isogenic SKM1 leukemia cells engineered to overexpress PIM1 were resistant to INCB54329 and were more sensitive to INCB53914 versus controls cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that inhibitory miRNAs, especially those located near super-enhancers, are suppressed by BET inhibition. Given that several miRNAs are known to control PIM1 expression, we hypothesized that paradoxical PIM1 upregulation following BETi treatment was due to down-regulation of select miRNAs. To test this, we treated our leukemia cell models with broad inhibitors of miRNA activity (i.e., AGO and Dicer inhibitors) and observed a dose dependent increase in PIM1 levels similar to that seen with BET inhibition(Fig. 1Di). Further, integrating public H3K27 CHIP-seq and miRNA super enhancer datasets and using computational prediction algorithms, we identified 6 candidate miRNAs that could regulate PIM1 and were predicted to be controlled by BET inhibitors. Of these, only miR-33a levels were reduced in a dose dependent manner in SKM1 cells by BETi treatment(Fig. 1Dii). This was confirmed by genetically silencing all BET proteins, which suppressed miR-33a levels in SKM1 leukemia cells. Finally, miR-33a mimics (but not control miRNAs) abolished BETi-induced upregulation of PIM1(Fig. 1Diii). Collectively, these studies established BET and PIM inhibition as a novel and potent combination therapy for CMML that is mediated by miR-33a-dependent upregulation of PIM1(Fig. 1E).
