    "abstract_text": "Identification of mechanisms underlying genomic instability is necessary to understand disease progression, including development of drug resistance. Our previous data demonstrates that dysregulation of DNA repair and maintenance/modification activities (including homologous recombination (HR), apurinic/apyrimidinic nuclease and APOBEC) significantly contribute to genomic instability in multiple myeloma (MM). However, how these and other pathways involved in genomic instability are dysregulated, remains to be explored. Since kinases play a critical role in the regulation of the maintenance of genomic integrity, we have performed a genome-wide kinome profiling to identify those involved in genomic instability in cancer. First, we analyzed genomic database for ten human cancers (including MM) from TCGA with both tumor cell gene expression and SNP/CGH array-based copy number information for each patient.We assessed genomic instability in each patient based on the total number of amplification and deletion events. We next interrogated all 550 kinases expressed in humans and identified those whose expression correlated with copy number alteration (based on FDR \u2264 0.05) in all tumor types. We identified six kinases whose elevated expression correlated with increased genomic instability defined by genomic amplification/deletion events in all ten cancers, including MM. To demonstrate functional relevance of these kinases, we conducted a CRISPR-based loss of function screen (using 3 guides per gene) in MM cells and evaluated the impact of each gene-knockout on micronuclei, a marker of ongoing genomic rearrangements and instability. For all six kinases, at least one guide resulted in \u2265 65% inhibition of micronuclei formation. Moreover, for five out of the six kinases, at least two guides showed \u2265 60% inhibition of micronuclei. All together, these data establishes a strong relevance of these kinases with genomic instability in MM. PDZ Binding Kinase (PBK) was among top kinases impacting genome stability in this data set with 2 out of 3 guides causing > 88% and 3 rd guide causing 35% inhibition of micronuclei formation. We further report that inhibition of PBK, by knockdown or small molecule, inhibits DNA breaks, RAD51 recombinase expression and homologous recombination in MM cells. We further investigated molecular mechanisms involved in PBK-mediated genomic instability in MM. Expression profiling using RNA sequencing of MM cells treated with a specific PBK inhibitor showed that top ten pathways downregulated by treatment were mostly DNA repair/recombination followed by replication and G2/M checkpoint. Interestingly, we identified a notable overlap between PBK-regulated genes with FOXM1 target genes. FOXM1 is a major transcriptional regulator of genes involved in DNA repair, G2/M regulation and chromosomal stability. We, therefore, investigated PBK/FOXM1 interaction and show that PBK interacts with FOXM1 in MM cells. Moreover, the inhibition of PBK, by knockdown or small molecule, inhibits phosphorylation of FOXM1 as well as downregulates FOXM1-regulated HR and cell cycle genes RAD51, EXO1 and CDC25A. These results suggest that PBK-dependent phosphorylation of FOXM1 activity controls transcriptional networks involved in genomic instability in MM. Ongoing work is investigating role of PBK and other kinases in progression of MGUS/SMM to active MM and their impact on ongoing genomic changes with influence on multiple DNA repair pathways including HR. In conclusion, we describe a kinase panel that may have significant role in maintaining genome stability, and their perturbation may allow to improve genome stability in MM.
