    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Fusarium species cause severe infections in patients with hematologic malignancies. The types of infection caused by Fusarium spp. in humans range from infections of nail, skin, and eye in immunocompetent host to invasive and disseminated infections in mainly immunocompromised patients. Methods: We retrospectively indentified patients with hematologic malignancy and positive cultures for Fusarium species at the University Hospital (1995-2014). Results: Thirteen cases were identified over study period. Patient demographic and underlying risk factors for fusariosis are presented in Table I. Most patients had uncontrolled hematological malignancy. All patients were neutropenic at diagnosis. Pulmonary involvement was evident in 3/13 patients (23%). Skin lesions were present in 2/13 (15%) patients. Fusariosis presented as a breakthrough infection in 8/13 (62%) of patients (Table II). Positive blood cultures were in the 6/13 (46%). Conclusions: Our study has several limitations due to its retrospective nature and its relatively small size. Fusariosis, althought uncommon, continues to have poor prognosis in neutropenic leukemic patients who present with fungemia. The optimal therapy for fusariosis remains undefined, because of its rarity and the complex clinical scenarious in patients with severe immunosupression. Table 1.
