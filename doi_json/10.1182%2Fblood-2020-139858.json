    "abstract_text": "Background: Selinexor (SEL) is a novel, first-in-class oral selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) which blocks XPO1, forcing the nuclear retention and activation of tumor suppressor proteins, ultimately causing apoptosis in cancer cells. The SVd regimen with once weekly (QW) oral SEL (100 mg), dexamethasone (dex) and QW bortezomib (BOR) had significantly increased progression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) with significantly reduced peripheral neuropathy as compared to standard twice weekly BOR/dex (Vd) in the phase III BOSTON study. Pomalidomide (POM) plus dex (Pd) achieved an ORR of 31% and PFS of 4 months in patients (pts) with disease refractory to BOR and lenalidomide (LEN). We hypothesize that the all oral Pd combination with the addition of QW SEL (SPd) would demonstrate improved activity and acceptable tolerability as compared with Pd. Methods: STOMP is a multicenter, open-label, phase 1b/2, dose escalation study with an expansion phase. Pts with RRMM who received \u2265 2 prior therapies including LEN and a proteasome inhibitor (in separate or the same regimens) were eligible for enrollment. Oral SEL was evaluated in 2 different dosing schedules in 28 days cycle: QW 60, 80 or 100 mg or twice weekly (BIW) 60 or 80 mg, with escalating doses of POM 2, 3 or 4 mg (days 1-21), and dex 20 mg BIW or 40 mg QW. The primary objectives of the study were to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to assess the safety, tolerability, ORR and PFS of the combination of SPd in pts with RRMM. Results: As of June 1 2020, 52 pts (28 male and 24 female) were enrolled. The median age was 64 (range: 43-85) years. Pts received a median of 3 (range: 1-10) prior therapies including 44 (84.6%) with autologous stem cell transplantation. During the escalation phase, eight dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed (Table 1). Common hematologic treatment related adverse events (TRAE) included (All Grades, Grades \u22653) neutropenia (62%, 56%), anemia (60%, 37%), and thrombocytopenia (56%, 35%). Common non-hematologic TRAE included nausea (62%, 2%), fatigue (56%, 12%), decreased appetite (48%, 2%), weight loss (42%, 0%), diarrhea (35%, 0%), vomiting (23%, 2%). Rates of \u2265 Grade 3 hematological TRAEs were lower in QW vs BIW schedules of SEL: thrombocytopenia (29% vs 44%) and anemia (32% vs 44%). Based on all of the safety data, the RP2D was SEL 60 mg QW, POM 4 mg (days 1-21), and DEX 40 mg QW. Out of 52 pts, 47 were evaluable for response. Previously treated / refractory rates were as follows (N=47 pts evaluable for efficacy): LEN (100% / 96%), BOR (94%, 45%), carfilzomib (38%, 34%), POM (30%, 30%), daratumumab (21%, 21%). Among POM na\u00efve pts (N=33), all pts (100%) received prior LEN and 31 pts (94%) had MM documented LEN refractory. Among pts who were POM naive (N=33), the ORR was 58% (1 CR, 5 very good partial responses and 13 partial responses) and the median PFS and OS were 12.3 and 19.0 months, respectively. Amongst pts who received POM previously (N=14), the ORR was 36% (1 VGPR and 4 PR), and the median PFS and OS were 8.8 and 8.0 months, respectively. Conclusions: The RP2D is SEL 60 mg QW, POM 4 mg QD and dex 40 mg QW. The ORR was 58% in pts in LEN treated or refractory and POM na\u00efve MM compared to previously published data of 31% ORR with Pd in a similar population. The median PFS on SPd of 12.3 months in POM na\u00efve pts is longer than that historically observed with Pd (~4 months). All TRAEs were expected and manageable with appropriate supportive care (eg, G-CSF) and/or dose modifications. The all oral SPd combination appears to confer relatively high ORR with good durability and promising PFS in pts with heavily pretreated MM.
