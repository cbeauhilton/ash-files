    "abstract_text": "BIW-8962 is a humanized anti-ganglioside GM2 (GM2) monoclonal antibody, produced by Poteligent technology to enhance ADCC activity. GM2 is expressed on many cancer cells including multiple myeloma (MM), small cell lung cancer and glioma cells. In this study, we evaluated the anti-myeloma activity of BIW-8962 in preclinical myeloma models both in vitro and in vivo . Expression of GM2 was analyzed in 15 human MM cell lines by FCM. Eleven out of 15 MM cell lines had positive surface expression of GM2. GM2 as a potential target was then verified in primary MM samples obtained from patients. Eleven out of 15 samples were positive for GM2. We then used two GM2 positive MM cell lines (U266B1 and KMS-11) and evaluated ADCC and CDC activity of BIW-8962 in vitro . BIW-8962 exhibited a potent ADCC and less potent CDC activity. In vivo anti-tumor activity of BIW-8962 was then examined using the standard subcutaneous xenograft model; KMS-11 was inoculated in the flank of SCID mice. BIW-8962 (intravenously administered biweekly for 3 weeks) exhibited a potent anti-tumor activity from as low a dose level as 0.1 mg/kg. Furthermore, in a more clinically relevant model, in which OPM-2/GFP (GM2 positive MM cell line) cells were intravenously inoculated into SCID mice with preferentially tumor growth within the bone marrow microenvironment, BIW-8962 (intravenously administered biweekly for 4 weeks, 10 mg/kg) suppressed OPM-2/GFP cell growth and serum M protein elevation, demonstrating in vivo anti-myeloma effect of BIW-8962. Our preclinical investigations rationalize clinical evaluation of BIW-8962 in patients with MM. Currently BIW-8962 is being investigated in a Phase 1 study in patients with multiple myeloma."
