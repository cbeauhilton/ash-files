    "abstract_text": "The search for novel inhibitors of the platelet \u03b1IIb\u03b23 receptor continues with the dual goals of better defining structure-function relationships and developing second generation oral agents. We previously reported on a novel small compound (Compound 1; RUC-1) identified by high throughput screening that inhibits human \u03b1IIb\u03b23. RUC-1 did not inhibit \u03b1V\u03b23, suggesting that it interacts with \u03b1IIb, and molecular docking studies supported this speculation. RUC-1 also induced less extensive changes in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 conformation than existing small molecule inhibitors, which may be therapeutically desirable. We have now studied RUC-1\u2019s effects on murine and rat platelets, which are less sensitive than human to inhibition by RGD peptides due to differences in the \u03b1IIb sequences contributing to the binding pocket. We found that RUC-1 (100 \u03bcM) was much less potent in inhibiting platelet aggregation of murine and rat platelets than human platelets or the platelets of a mouse expressing a hybrid receptor composed of human \u03b1IIb and murine \u03b23 (h\u03b1IIb/m\u03b23) (mouse, 6\u00b16%, n=4; rat, 0\u00b115%, n=3; human, 97\u00b12% n=3; h\u03b1IIb/m\u03b23 99\u00b11%, n=4). RUC-1 also inhibited fibrinogen binding to murine platelets expressing the hybrid h\u03b1IIb/m\u03b23 receptor (94\u00b1 2%, n=4), but not a hybrid receptor composed of murine \u03b1IIb and human \u03b23 (m\u03b1IIb/h\u03b23; 0%, n=4). Molecular docking studies of RUC-1 were consistent with the functional data with RUC-1 binding entirely within the \u03b2-propeller. \u03b1IIb In vivo studies of RUC-1 administered intraperitoneally (IP) at a dose of 26.5 mg/kg demonstrated antithrombotic effects in the FeCl 3 carotid artery model in mice expressing h\u03b1IIb/m\u03b23 (Figure 1A), but did not protect WT mice from thrombotic occlusion at the same dose (Figure 1B). Collectively, these data support RUC-1\u2019s specificity for \u03b1IIb, provide new insights into the \u03b1IIb ligand-binding pocket, and establish RUC-1\u2019s anti-thrombotic effects in vivo . In addition, the h\u03b1IIb/m\u03b23 mice provide a convenient model for testing low molecular weight \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonist drugs such as RUC-1 for toxicity and therapeutic potential. Figure 1. View large Download slide RUC-1 protects h\u03b1IIb/m\u03b23 mice, but not WT mice from FeCl3-induced carotid artery thrombotic occlusion. A. Mice expressing h\u03b1IIb/m\u03b23 receptor were injected IP with vehicle control (n=4), an inactive congener of RUC-1 (RUC-1-piperidine; n=4; 26.5 mg/kg), or RUC-1 (n=7; 26.5 mg/kg) 25 min before carotid artery injury with 20% FeCl3 for 3 min. Blood flow through the carotid artery was monitored for 30 min with a Doppler flow probe. Kaplan-Meier analysis was calculated from the time the FeCl3 was applied to the artery until complete occlusion. The control curve contains the combined data from the mice treated with vehicle and RUC-1-piperidine. B. WT mice (n=4) were given RUC-1 (26.5 mg/kg) and their data are compared to those reported in panel A for mice expressing h\u03b1IIb/m\u03b23. Figure 1.
