    "abstract_text": "Thrombin generation assay (TGA) was recently evaluated on a living endothelial-derived cell line (Coll et al. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2013; 11, 1916). This innovative assay brought into an hemostasis assay the cellular components of the anticoagulation pathway (APC and TFPI pathways) as well as a activated cell surface. It might help elucidate the relationship between hemostasis and inflammation in a more complex system. In the aim of evaluating the potential of antithrombin (AT) connecting both processes we set-up a similar assay on human vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We first demonstrated that thrombin generation can be measured in flat-bottom 96-wells in factor IX-or factor VIII-deficient plasma substituted by either 0.1 or 1 U/ml of FIX or FVIII, respectively. Next, HUVEC were grown and expanded in a complete commercial medium (EndoGRO-LS, Millipore) for no more than 6 passages. Wells were then coated with gelatin 1% and cells seeded at 10,000 cells/well. The binding of plasma-derived AT (Aclotine \u00ae, LFB; France dialyzed in cell culture medium) to HUVEC was demonstrated as being dose- (0.5; 1; 2.5 and 5 U/ml) and time- (0-6 hours) dependent. Saturating conditions were found using 2.5 U/ml AT for a 2h incubation. We also showed that the binding was moderately affected in the presence of heparin at concentrations up to 50 U/ml (loss of 19% of the signal) and not at all following an heparanase I+II+III treatment suggesting that another receptor(s) than cellular heparan sulfates being responsible for this interaction. The effect of AT on coagulation was then compared in the presence of cells or not. To do this cells were grown to confluence, washed with non-supplemented medium and incubated in the presence of the TGA mix (plasma containing AT or not, 0.5 pM Tissue Factor, 4 \u00b5M Phospholipids). The reaction was initiated by injection of the FluCa kit thrombin substrate (Stago). In the presence of HUVEC, the efficiency of thrombin generation from a control plasma (Unicalibrator, Stago) was decreased with a lag time increased (from 5.67 min to 6.83 min), the peak height diminished from 204.4 nM thrombin to 150.4 nM and the velocity from 55.8 nM/min to 33.4 nM/min. However, the overall amount of thrombin generated was less affected, diminishing from 1515.5 nM to 1482 nM. These data confirms that the presence of the HUVEC anticoagulants pathways can effectively diminish the thrombin generation. Without cells, the presence of 0.5, 1 or 2 U/ml AT dose-dependently decreased the generation of thrombin from the control plasma. The velocity was decreased by 23.2%, 57.6% and 75.5% and the peak height by 33.5%, 61.5% and 78.8%, respectively. When the same experiment was performed in the presence of HUVEC cells, the concentrations of AT similarly decreased the velocity by 34.2%, 54% and 70 % and the peak height by 39%, 59.1% 74.3%, respectively. There was no difference in the TGA parameters if AT was pre-incubated at the surface of the cells for up to 2h prior the TGA or if it was added extemporaneously. These results indicate that the presence of HUVEC did not modulate the in vitro effect of AT during coagulation. The effect of AT on the cell response during this process are in the process of being investigated with a particular focus on the anti-inflammatory properties of AT.
