    "abstract_text": "We reported that complement cascade (CC) becomes activated in bone marrow (BM) during mobilization of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) by i) immunoglobulin (Ig)-dependent pathway and/or by ii) alternative Ig-independent pathway and, as result of this, iii) several potent bioactive CC anaphylatoxins (C3a, desArg C3a, C5a and desArg C5a) are released ( Blood  2003 ; 101 , 3784 ; Blood  2004 ; 103 , 2071 ; Blood  2005 ; 105 , 40 ). To learn more on the role of CC and innate immunity in this process, we compared mobilization in mice that possess defects in CC activation by i) classical pathway (C1q \u2212/\u2212 , Ig-deficient), ii) both classical and alternative pathway (C2fB \u2212/\u2212 ) and in animals iii) that do not generate CC-derived anaphylatoxins (C3 \u2212/\u2212 , C5 \u2212/\u2212 ). For mobilization, we employed G-CSF and zymosan that activate classical and alternative pathways of CC, respectively. First, we found by ELISA that CC activation in fact correlates with the level of HSPC mobilization. Next, studies in mice deficient in CC activation revealed that CC plays both pivotal and pleiotropic roles in this process. Accordingly, while C1q \u2212/\u2212 and C3 \u2212/\u2212 mice turned out to be easy mobilizers, mobilization was very poor in Ig-deficient, C2fB \u2212/\u2212 and C5 \u2212/\u2212 mice that demonstrate that C3 and C5 cleavage fragments differently control the mobilization of HSPC. To explain this at molecular level, we found that C3 cleavage fragments (C3a, desArg C3a) directly interact with HSPC and increase their responsiveness to SDF-1 gradient and thus prevent uncontrolled egress of HSPC from BM. It explains why C1q \u2212/\u2212 and C3 \u2212/\u2212 mice that do not generate C3 cleavage fragments in BM release easily HSPC into circulation. In contrast, C5 cleavage fragments (C5a, desArg C5a) increase permeability of BM-endothelium and thus are crucial for the egress of HSPC from BM to occur. This explains why mice that do not activate efficient CC such as Ig-deficient, C2fB \u2212/\u2212 and C5 \u2212/\u2212 animals are poor mobilizers. We conclude that the mobilization of HSPC is i) dependent on C activation by the classical or alternative pathway and balanced differently by C3 and C5 cleavage fragments that enhance retention or promote egress of HSPC respectively. Thus, modulation of C activation in BM may help to develop new more efficient strategies for both HSPC mobilization and their homing/engraftment."
