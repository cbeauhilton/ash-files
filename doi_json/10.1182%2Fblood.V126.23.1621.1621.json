    "abstract_text": "Introduction The Classic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs), characterised by an over production of one or more cells of the myeloid lineage, are classified into polycythaemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Despite the identification of numerous genetic mutations, a paucity of information relating to medical and lifestyle factors contributing to the aetiology of these diseases remains. Methods The MOSAICC Study was an exploratory case-control study of MPNs. MPN patients were recruited between two sites, Belfast and Southampton, in preparation for a planned UK-wide investigation. Population controls (identified by General Practitioners) and non-blood relative/friend controls were also recruited. Participants completed a telephone-based questionnaire seeking information on a range of medical, environmental, lifestyle and occupational risk factors. Risk factors were assessed using unconditional logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders. Results Risk factors identified included smoking [\u226525 pack years vs. never: odds ratio (OR) 3.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-7.87], increasing childhood household density [>2 vs <1 Child(ren)/room: OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.31-8.30], history of heart disease (OR 3.31, 95% CI 1.23-8.87), CT scans (\u22653 vs. none: OR 4.92, 95% CI 1.55-15.67), having an implant (OR 10.77, 95% CI 1.01-3.10), and pig ownership (OR 5.92, 95% CI 1.17-29.92). Alcohol was associated with a reduced risk of MPNs (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28-0.88) as was home working on car exhausts (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.88), painting at home (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28-0.86) and short haul air travel (p for trend 0.012). Participants working in occupations with high exposure to environmental tobacco smoke had an excess risk of MPN (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.12-5.37). Work-based radiation and solvent exposure also appeared to increase risk of MPNs (p<0.05). Conclusions This exploratory study has confirmed a reported association between cigarette smoking and MPNs. It has identified some potential novel risk factors including work-based radiation and solvent exposure. The findings of this study need to be replicated in a larger, adequately powered, study in order to identify important risk factors for the classic MPNs.
