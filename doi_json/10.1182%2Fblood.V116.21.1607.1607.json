    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1607 The polycomb group (PcG) proteins form chromatin-modifying complexes that implement transcriptional silencing. There are two major PcG complexes, polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 1 and PRC2. PRC1 ubiquitylates histone H2A at lysine 119 and PRC2 trimethylates lysine 27 of histone H3. Among PcG proteins, Bmi1, a core component of PRC1, plays an essential role in the self-renewal and maintenance of various kinds of stem cells including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), neural stem cells, and leukemic stem cells. We previously reported that forced expression of Bmi1 using a Bmi1 retrovirus promotes symmetrical cell division of HSCs, resulting in a marked ex vivo expansion of multipotent progenitors and an enhancement of repopulating capacity of HSCs in vivo . However, the impact of overexpression of Bmi1 in HSCs remains to be precisely addressed. To this end, we generated a mouse line where Bmi1 can be conditionally overexpressed under the control of the Rosa promoter in a tissue-specific fashion by the Cre-LoxP system. We crossed the mice to Tie2-Cre mice ( Tie2-Cre ; Rosa-Bmi1 fl/+ ) and induced overexpression of Bmi1 in hematopoietic cells in vivo . Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that expression of Bmi1 inpurified bone marrow (BM) c-Kit + Sca-1 + Lineage-marker - (KSL) cells was 6-fold higher in Tie2-Cre ; Rosa-Bmi1 fl/+ mice than control Tie2-Cre mice mice. Overexpression of Bmi1 did not significantly affect steady state hematopoiesis. The number of HSCs and progenitors (multipotent progenitors, CMPs, GMP, MEPs, and CLPs) and lineage composition (myeloid cells, B cells, and T cells) in BM of Tie2-Cre; Rosa-Bmi1 fl/+ mice was not significantly changed compared to those in control mice. We then performed serial transplantation assay. The repopulating capacity of Tie2-Cre; Rosa-Bmi1 fl/+ BM cells was comparable to those of the control cells in primary recipients. However, Tie2-Cre; Rosa-Bmi1 fl/+ cells retained higher repopulating capacity during serial transplantation compared to those of the control cells. Moreover, ex vivo culture of Tie2-Cre; Rosa-Bmi1 fl/+ HSCs for 10 days contained approximately 2-fold more high proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFCs; colony diameter>1mm) and colony-forming unit-neutrophil/macrophage/erythroblast/megakaryocyte (CFU-nmEM) which retain multi-lineage differentiation potential along myeloid lineage than the control. Of note, cells in ex vivo culture of Tie2-Cre; Rosa-Bmi1 fl/+ HSCs exhibited significantly augmented repopulating capacity in recipient mice and we are now engaged in competitive repopulation unit (CRU) assays to determine the net HSC expansion by overexpression of Bmi1 during ex vivo culture. These results indicate that overexpression of Bmi1 confers stress resistance to HSCs during ex vivo culture and serial transplantation. Our findings also provide Bmi1 as a potential target for efficient manipulation of HSCs ex vivo . Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
