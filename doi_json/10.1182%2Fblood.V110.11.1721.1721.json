    "abstract_text": "Bariatric surgery has become an important means to reduce obesity and its related morbidity. Bariatric surgeries in the US have increased from 14,000 in 1998 to 140,000 in 2004. Malabsorption and achlorhydria can complicate bariatric surgery and may lead to iron deficiency and anemia. In this setting, little is known about the prevalence and severity of anemia and the efficacy of oral iron replacement, a common part of post-surgical management. We reviewed the records at our institution of a large number (n=1125; 126 men; 999 women) of patients followed for up to 4 yrs post-procedure for the development of anemia and assessment of vitamin levels and iron stores. METHODS: Body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin (Hb), B12, folate, serum iron and ferritin values were extracted from electronic records of the patients at baseline, and 250 patients (33 men; 217 women) followed out to 4 yrs after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Anemia was defined by age- and gender-specific WHO criteria. RESULTS: Mean BMI fell from 50.1 (CI 49.6\u201350.6) at baseline to 33.1 (CI 29.8\u201336.4) at 4 yrs. Anemia was present in 12% of all patients at baseline and was similar between men (9%) and women (12%). At 18mos, 29% of woman 50 yrs (p=0.02). For patients followed out to 2\u20134 yrs, 21% were anemic and women 50 yrs (15%; p=0.02). The incidence of anemia among men did not change over the period of observation. In all patients the mean Hb decreased from 13.4 g/dL (CI 13.3\u201313.5) at baseline to 12.1 g/dL (CI 11.1\u201313.1; p 50 years, the mean ferritin was 63 ng/mL (CI 45.3\u201380.5); 54% had ferritins <50 ng/mL and, of these, only 15% were anemic (p=0.04). Of the 4% with a ferritin <20 ng/mL, 25% were anemic. Mean B12 and folate levels remained stable and did not correlate with anemia. In contrast to ferritin, mean serum iron values did not decrease. Interpretation of this finding is difficult since total iron binding capacity was not measured simultaneously and supplemental iron intake might be confounding. CONCLUSIONS: although oral iron, folate and vitamin B12 supplements were routinely prescribed after surgery, anemia was a common complication and its frequency increased with time. Negative iron balance was progressive, despite oral iron supplementation. While iron deficiency did not account for all cases of anemia, it is sufficiently common to warrant careful evaluation of the ability of bariatric patients to absorb iron and/or comply with life-long oral iron supplementation. Given the rapidly increasing number of bariatric procedures in the US, all physicians should be alerted to the possible need for parenteral iron therapy to prevent anemia and its complications.",
