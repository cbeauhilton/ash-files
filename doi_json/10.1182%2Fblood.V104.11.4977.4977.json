    "abstract_text": "Murine xenograft models of human T cell (HuT) mediated graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) are of potential value but limited by poor engraftment and low and variable incidence of clinical GvHD even after injection of >10 8 HuT cells. The NOD SCID \u03b22M null mice (\u03b22 mice) lack macrophage activity, T, B and NK cells and represent an improved target for HuT cell expansion and activation compared to other immunodeficient mouse models. To induce GvHD, sublethally irradiated \u03b22 mice were injected intravenously via the tail vein (iv) or retroorbitally (ro) with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (huPBMC) or purified HuT (98% purity). \u03b22 mice conditioned with 250cGy and injected iv with huPBMC (10 7 T cells;n=4) or HuT (0.5\u20132x10 7 T cells;n=28) failed to engraft and did not develop GvHD. In contrast, \u03b22 mice conditioned with 250cGy and injected ro with huPBMC (10 7 T cells;n=11) or HuT cells (10 7 ;n=14) exhibited 19% HuT engraftment 2\u20133 weeks post-infusion and developed weight loss (>20%) consistent with lethal GvHD, with an overall survival of 82% and 21%, respectively, at 5 weeks (p=0.006). Addition of IL-2 (3x10 5 IU IP/TIW) had no effect on T cell expansion or GvHD. FACS analysis demonstrated HuT infiltration in the spleen (46%), liver (60%), lung (49%), kidney (40%), and bone marrow (11%). Histological analysis showed an extensive and diffuse accumulation of immature lymphocytes in the spleen, thymus and lymph nodes, and a perivascular infiltration in the lung, liver, kidney but not in the skin or gut. The immunohistochemestry confirmed that these cells were HuT (human CD45+ and CD3+). Furthermore, we observed a 10\u201315 fold increase in the expression of T cell activation markers CD25, CD30, and CD69 in both the peripheral blood and tissues, compared with naive T cells or T cells from mice that did not develop GvHD. We also evaluated the levels of various human cytokines in the serum of the \u03b22 mice using a cytometric bead array multiplex assay. On day 10 after the injection of HuT and before the start of any clinical sign of GvHD, mice that went on to develop lethal GvHD had 90 times higher levels of IFN\u03b3 in serum (>5000pg/ml) compared to mice that did not develop GVHD (<62 pg/ml) (p=0.003). Interestingly both had nearly identical numbers of HuT/ul in blood (32+39 and 33+41 HuT/ul) on day 10. We also observed a significant increase in human IL-10 levels and TNF\u03b1 in mice that developed GvHD. Mice that developed lethal GvHD had a 70 fold increase of HuT/ul in the 3 rd week (1550 versus 22/ul p<0.003). We improved this model by depletion of murine macrophages using clodronate-containing liposomes (clod) administered iv before the HuT injections. Mice injected with 5x10 6 HuT with clod developed lethal GvHD (3/3) on day 15.7+1.5, with 10 7 HuT (3/3) on day 10.3+5.4 and mice injected with 10 7 HuT without clod on day 13.4+5.4 (8/12)(p2.5. Conclusion: NOD-SCID-\u03b22M null xenotransplant model is uniquely permissive for human T cell expansion after sublethal radiation and may be used as a preclinical platform to study the impact of ex-vivo manipulation and genetic modification of human T cell as GvHD.",
