    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1829 Proinflammatory cytokines are suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM). TNF-a, a potent mediator of inflammation, is involved in the malignant transformation of plasma cells and plasma cell proliferation. TNF-a determination was also reported to be a good parameter for monitoring therapy outcome during treatment with different protocols. Variation in TNF-a levels can be related to gene expression, which is regulated at transcriptional level, as well as to genetic polymorphism (SNP). Specifically, a G to A substitution at position -308 is associated with higher levels of TNF-a. From September 2006 to April 2010 we selected 202 MM patients and 234 control cases matched for age and sex. TNF-a SNP at position -308 was determined on genomic DNA extracted from blood samples. These genotypes frequencies obtained were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Our results indicate that the cytokine TNF-a gene SNP do not confer differences in the susceptibility of MM. Then, we studied the correlation between the SNPs of TNF-a -308 and the outcome of 91 MM patients that underwent to autologous bone marrow transplantation (ASCT) after a similar induction therapy (DAV or TAD). Melphalan 200 mg/mq (or 100 mg/mq, for the elderly patients) was used as conditioning regimen ( table I ). In the MM carrying the rarest A allele of TNF-a the overall response to chemotherapy and outcome to ASCT were similar to patients carriers G allele. On the contrary TNF-a seems to be an independent factor to predict the outcome in patients affected by MM modifying the progression free survival age related, if patients are > 60 yrs ( p= 0.02 ). In particular pts > 60 years carrying the G/G genotype showed a better progression free survival compared to the same age patients carrying A/A or G/A genotypes ( table II and table III ). Previous studies demonstrated that an higher plasma TNF-a concentration is significantly associated with advancing age and the combination of TNF-a and melphalan results in high response rates. Several mechanisms could be responsible for this, in particular a direct effect of TNF-a on the anti-tumour activity of melphalan. In our population the high dose of melphalan used in the youngest population is able to mask the role of TNF-a, but in the elderly patients it is clear as the impact of polymorphism plays a role in the better PFS of patients carrying the G/G genotype. To conclude we confirm the interesting role of TNF-a SNP in the outcome of MM in particular in the subset of pts characterized by a physiological high production of TNF-a.
