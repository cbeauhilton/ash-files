    "abstract_text": "Background Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) constitutes a curative treatment for children with malignant and non-malignant disorders. HLA-partially matched haploidentical (haplo) donors represent a viable alternative option for those children who lack an HLA-compatible donor. T-cell depletion approaches with positive (CD34 selection) or negative selection (alpha/beta T-cell and CD19+ B-cell-depletion) may allow engraftment of donor cells with a low risk of GvHD; however, success is limited by delayed immune recovery, increasing the risk of fatal infections. Infusion of unmanipulated donor T cells (DLI) to accelerate immune recovery is associated with high risk of fatal GVHD. In contrast, adoptive transfer of donor T cells genetically manipulated to include a safety switch can be a suitable strategy to render DLI safer and more widely applicable. BPX-501 is an allogeneic product consisting of T cells modified to express the inducible caspase-9 (iC9) safety switch. The polyclonal natural of these modified T cells can provide viral immunity following stem cell transplant, with the unique ability to promptly and durably resolve GvHD symptoms following the administration of rimiducid, an inert, lipid-permeable compound that rapidly induces dimerization and activation of iC9, inducing apoptosis of the gene modified T cells. Aims To evaluate the safety and efficacy of rimiducid in the treatment of GvHD following administration of BPX-501 T cells in pediatric patients with malignant or non-malignant disorders given an \u03b1\u03b2 T-cell receptor and B-cell depleted haplo-HSCT. A key objective of this study is to assess the activity of rimiducid infusion following onset of GvHD which is refractory to standard of care therapies. Methods Two multicenter (US [NCT03301168] and EU [NCT02065869]), prospective trials utilized \u03b1\u03b2-T-cell and B-cell-depleted haplo-HSCT followed by infusion of a titrated number of donor lymphocytes genetically modified with iC9 (BPX-501 T cells) in patients with malignant or non-malignant disorders. BPX-501 T-cells were planned to be infused on day14+/-4 after the allograft. No post-transplant pharmacological GvHD prophylaxis was employed. Patients who develop GvHD resistant to conventional steroid therapy could receive \u22651 dose of dimerizing rimiducid to activate the iC9 safety gene. The efficacy evaluable population is defined as any patient who received \u2265 1 dose of rimiducid for the treatment of GvHD and had a follow up response assessment. Results At the time of clinical cut-off (June 30 th , 2018) 249 patients with a malignant (41.4%) or non-malignant disorder (58.6%) were enrolled. The conditioning regimens varied according to the original disease and were Treosulfan-based (14.9%), Busulfan-based (28.9%), TBI-based (34.9%) or other (19.3%). The donor was a parent in 229 children (92 %), a sibling in 17 (6.8 %), and a half-sibling in the remaining 3 (1.2 %). The median time to BPX-501 infusion was 18 days (10 - 66 days). Fifty-two patients developed Grade I-IV aGvHD (cumulative incidence [CI] 21.9 % [95% confidence interval (CoI): 16.7 - 27.2]). Twenty-six patients developed Grade II-IV aGvHD (CI 10.9 %). Five patients developed Grade III-IV aGvHD (CI 2.1 %). Eight patients developed cGvHD (CI of 4.6% [95% CoI: 1.3 - 7.8]). Twenty-one patients met the rimiducid efficacy evaluable population definition. An overall clinical response rate of 86% was observed. A CR or PR to rimiducid was observed in 12 and 6 patients, respectively. Median time to initial response was 2 days (1-61 days). Median number of doses received was 1 (1 - 2). At a median follow-up of 7.8 months (2.3 - 30.8 months), 77% of the initial responders were still in either complete (n=8) or partial response (n=6). Conclusion These data suggest that administration of rimiducid for treatment of steroid-refractory GvHD represents a novel and highly effective treatment approach in pediatric patients with non-malignant or malignant disorders who received a \u03b1\u03b2-T-cell and B-cell depleted haplo-HSCT followed by infusion of BPX-501 cells. The administration of rimiducid in children given BPX-501 T cells allows for effective control of GvHD occurring after the adoptive transfer of genetically modified T cells.
