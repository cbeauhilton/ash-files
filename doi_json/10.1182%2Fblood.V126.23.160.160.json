    "abstract_text": "Pomalidomide, a second-generation immunomodulatory drug, is a fetal hemoglobin (HbF) inducing agent with potential implications for the treatment of \u03b2-hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease (SCD). However, its mechanism of action remains unknown. Through an in-depth characterization of human erythropoiesis and globin gene regulatory networks, we now provide evidence that pomalidomide alters transcription networks involved in erythropoiesis and globin switching, thereby leading to a partial reprogramming of adult hematopoietic progenitors toward fetal-like erythropoiesis. Adult peripheral blood CD34+ cells from normal individuals were differentiated toward the red cell lineage using an adapted 3-phase culture system. At day 14 of culture, we observed a reciprocal globin gene switch at the mRNA and protein levels. These results were confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography of hemolysates (HbF/(HbF+HbA): 31.7 \u00b1 1.4% vs. 6.5 \u00b1 0.7% pomalidomide and vehicle, respectively). Next, we studied erythroid differentiation using flow cytometric analyses of the cell surface markers interleukin-3R (IL-3R), glycophorin A (GPA), CD34 and CD36 for early erythroid precursors (BFU-E and CFU-E) as well as GPA, \u03b14-integrin and band3 for terminal erythroid differentiation. While there were no changes in terminal erythroblast maturation, an accumulation of BFU-E in pomalidomide-treated cultures at days 2 and 4 of differentiation was seen, indicating a delay at the BFU-E to CFU-E transition, and also, that pomalidomide exerts its effect in the early-stages of erythropoiesis. Indeed, treatment with pomalidomide during the phase of the culture system that generates erythroid progenitors led to significantly more \u03b3-globin expression than treatment during the phase which proerythroblasts undergo terminal erythroid differentiation. At the molecular level, pomalidomide was found to rapidly and robustly decrease Ikaros ( IKZF1 ) expression exclusively by post-translational targeting to the proteasome. Moreover, pomalidomide selectively reduced the expression of components of key globin regulatory pathways including BCL11A , SOX6 , KLF1, GATA1 and LSD1 while not affecting others ( e.g. CoREST , GATA2 , GFI1B , and HDAC1 ). Pomalidomide had a transient effect on GATA1 and KLF1 expression. While shRNA knockdown of Ikaros using two different lentiviral constructs delayed erythroid differentiation, it failed to appreciably stimulate HbF production or alter BCL11A expression. These results suggest that the loss of Ikaros alone is insufficient to recapitulate the phenotype observed in pomalidomide-treated conditions. We next compared the expression levels of proteins involved in globin gene regulation among untreated peripheral blood, pomalidomide-treated peripheral blood and untreated cord blood-derived erythroid cells. We found striking similarities between cord blood and pomalidomide-treated adult cells at day 4 of differentiation. Indeed, BCL11A, KLF1, SOX6, LSD1 and GATA1 showed decreased expression levels both in cord blood and pomalidomide-treated adult peripheral blood, while the levels of CoREST, HDAC1 and GATA2 remained unchanged indicating that pomalidomide partially reprograms adult erythroid cells to a fetal-like state. Taken together, our results show that the mechanism underlying reactivation of HbF by pomalidomide involves Ikaros-independent reprogramming of adult erythroid progenitors. Finally, we found that this mechanism is conserved in SCD-derived CD34+ cells. Our work has broad implications for globin switching, as we provide direct evidence that Ikaros does not play a major role in the repression of \u03b3-globin during adult erythropoiesis, and further supports the previously held notion that globin chain production is determined prior to or at the level of CFU-E.
