    "abstract_text": "Globin gene expression undergoes developmental switching from embryonic (\u03b5) through fetal (\u03b3) to adult (\u03b4 and \u03b2) genes. Inherited mutations or deletions at the \u03b2-gene cause beta-thalassemia. One of the most propitious strategies of treatment for the disease is forced switching from mutated \u03b2-gene to unaffected fetal \u03b3-gene expression in adult erythroid cells. Expression of globin genes is regulated by the upstream LCR enhancer. The LCR enhancer loops to globin gene promoters utilizing the LDB1/GATA-1/TAL1/LMO2 protein complex. Additionally histone-modifying enzymes play a significant role in regulation of globin gene expression. G9a methyltransferase, responsible for establishing H3K9me2 histone modification, is involved in repressing fetal and activating adult globin gene expression in mouse erythroid cells. Moreover, inhibition of G9a methyltransferase activity by the synthetic chemical compound UNC0638 activates \u03b3- and represses \u03b2-gene expression in adult human hematopoietic precursor CD34(+) cells. Using ex vivo differentiation of primary CD34(+) adult human cells as a model system, we investigated the effect of UNC0638 on switching from \u03b2- to \u03b3-globin gene expression, LDB1 complex occupancy and LCR/\u03b2-gene promoter looping patterns in adult erythroblast cells. Human peripheral blood CD34(+) progenitor cells from three healthy adult donors were differentiated for 21 days in a three phase serum-free media system. Based upon dose titration studies, 1\u00b5M UNC0638 was added to the medium during the most proliferative phase of culture (days 7-14) and compared to control cells grown without UNC0638. Under these conditions, a highly significant 5-fold increase in \u03b3-globin gene expression was observed. UNC0638 treatment also caused a pronounced (3-fold) reduction in \u03b2-globin gene expression without substantial change in \u03b1-globin. At the end of the culture period, HPLC analyses also demonstrated that UNC0638 treatment resulted in a considerable increase in the cellular fetal hemoglobin (HbF / HbA + HbF: control: 2.9 +/- 1.2%; UNC0638: 30.9 +/- 2.5%, p=0.003). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and chromosome conformation capture assays were utilized to determine if the increase of fetal hemoglobin along with activation of \u03b3-gene expression and concomitant reduction of \u03b2-gene expression were associated with epigenetic modification of the \u03b2-globin locus. UNC0638 erased H3K9me2 histone modification in the \u03b2-globin locus and caused changes in LCR looping from interaction with the \u03b2- to the \u03b3-globin gene. Mirroring differences in looping pattern, LDB1 containing protein complex occupancy was significantly increased at the \u03b3-globin gene and decreased at \u03b4- and \u03b2-gene promoters. These results support a model whereby G9a establishes conditions preventing activation of \u03b3-gene by interacting with the LCR and facilitating LCR looping with \u03b4- and \u03b2-gene promoters and subsequent strong activation of adult globin genes expression during differentiation of adult erythroid progenitor cells. In this view, G9a inhibition represents a promising approach for treatment of \u03b2-hemoglobinopathies. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
