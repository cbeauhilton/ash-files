    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3337 Poster Board III-225 In the past decade there has been a significant increase in the use of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). RIC HSCT is associated with reduced transplant related mortality, but also with an increased risk of relapse and graft rejection. Little is known about factors associated with graft rejection. Based on early animal models, intensified cyclosporine (CyA) administration is considered an essential component of RIC HSCT with minimal conditioning. We were interested in analyzing the role of CyA in graft rejection following RIC HSCT. Between October 1999 and December 2008, 85 patients received an allogeneic RIC HSCT with fludarabine 3 \u00d7 30 mg/m 2 and 2 Gy TBI as conditioning at our institution. 6 patients were excluded from the analysis due to graft loss associated with relapse or progressive disease, 2 were excluded for missing data. Diseases were acute leukemia (N=19), MDS (N=11), CML/MPN (N=10), lymphoma (N=24), multiple myeloma (N=12), and pure white cell aplasia (N=1). Donors were HLA-identical siblings (N=54) or unrelated donors (N=23). Graft source was peripheral blood (N=74) or bone marrow (N=3). Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of CyA and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). CyA was started at a dose of 6.25mg/kg p.o. twice daily and adjusted according to trough levels (measured weekly) and toxicity. MMF was administered at a dose of 15mg/kg twice daily; trough levels were not analyzed systematically. For the analysis of impact on graft rejection, CyA levels between day 1 and 28 where summarized as mean trough levels. Graft rejection was defined as 600 ng/ml (N=9) (p=0.002) (Figure A) and a median donor chimerism at day 28 of 99%, 84%, and 72% respectively (p=0.004). In a multivariate analysis, two factors remained significantly associated with graft rejection: unrelated donor (HR vs. sibling donor 4.52, p = 0.03), and mean trough level of CyA for days 1-28 (HR 1.006 per ng/ml increase, p=0.001). Patients with CML/MPN had an increased risk of rejection (HR 1.36 versus other patients combined, p=0.65) which did not reach statistical significance. The overall survival of the entire patient group was 55% at five years; patients with stable engraftment had a five-year survival rate of 61%, those rejecting their graft 36% (p=0.04). These data indicate that elevated CyA levels during the first month posttransplant might be associated with an increased risk of graft rejection. The potentially detrimental effects of high CyA levels have been described previously in the myeloablative setting, where a correlation between CyA levels and risk of relapse has been shown. Further studies will be needed to better define the exact role of CyA following RIC regimens.
