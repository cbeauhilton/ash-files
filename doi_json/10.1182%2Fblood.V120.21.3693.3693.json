    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3693 Background: Histopathologically, some FLs have components of DLBCL at diagnosis. In the pre-rituximab era, there were two reports regarding the characteristics and prognosis of patients (pts) with these particular FLs 1,2) . Hans et al. reported that the overall survival (OS) of pts with FL grade 3 having a predominant (> 50%) DLBCL component is similar to that of pts with DLBCL 1) . Ghesquie\u0300res et al. concluded that pts with DLBCL presenting with a low-grade component have a similar OS to those with de novo DLBCL 2) . However, the clinical implications and prognosis of FL pts with coexisting DLBCL at diagnosis undergoing rituximab-containing chemotherapy remain unclear. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathologic features of 59 FL pts with coexisting DLBCL (FL/DLBCL) initially undergoing rituximab-containing chemotherapy. Furthermore, the prognosis of FL/DLBCL pts was compared with that of 223 FL pts without DLBCL as well as 285 DLBCL pts without FL 3) . All pts received a rituximab-containing regimen as the initial chemotherapy. These pts with FL/DLBCL or FL were diagnosed and treated at our institution between 2001 and 2010, and DLBCL pts between 2003 and 2010. Results: The median age of the 59 pts with FL/DLBCL was 54 years (range: 22\u201383). Among them, 41 (69%) pts had FL grade 1\u20133a and the remaining 18 (31%) had FL grade 3b components. Thirty (51%) pts had a predominant (> 50%) DLBCL component. With regard to treatment, all pts except one received the R-CHOP regimen. Forty-nine (83%) pts achieved CR, but 22 of them (37%) relapsed. With a median follow-up of 5.4 years, the estimated 5-year OS and progression-free survival (PFS) for all 59 pts were 83 and 64%, respectively. The International Prognostic Index (IPI) and FLIPI were not correlated with OS and PFS, whereas the revised-IPI (R-IPI) and FLIPI2 were significantly correlated with PFS. A predominant DLBCL component was predictive of neither OS nor PFS. In the 41 pts with FL grade 1\u20133a with DLBCL, %CR, 5-year OS, and PFS rates were 80, 84, and 60%, respectively. On the other hand, in the 18 pts with FL grade 3b with DLBCL, they were 89, 82, and 72%, respectively. The %CR and PFS rates of the latter cohort showed superior tendencies to those of the former cohort, with no statistically significant difference. Among 22 relapses, 10 were confirmed histologically: 5 DLBCL, 4 FL, and 1 HL. In 16 relapsed pts with FL grade 1\u20133a at initial diagnosis, 4 relapsed as FL, one each as DLBCL and HL. Two pts who had relapsed as FL and HL subsequently developed DLBCL. On the other hand, 4 out of 5 relapsed pts with FL grade 3b at the initial diagnosis relapsed as DLBCL. Additionally, the prognosis of FL/DLBCL pts was compared with that of FL and DLBCL pts. The 5-year OS rate of FL/DLBCL pts (83%) was significantly worse than that of DLBCL pts (91%, p=0.039) as well as FL pts (97%, p=0.001) ( Fig 1 ). The 5-year PFS rate of FL/DLBCL pts (64%) was not significantly different from that of DLBCL pts (72%, p=0.120). The PFS curves ( Fig 2 ) suggested a slight increase in progression or mortality in FL/DLBCL pts during the first 2 years. However, the FL/DLBCL pts had a low incidence of events after 2 years. The PFS curve of FL/DLBCL pts was similar to that of DLBCL pts. By multivariate analysis of pts with FL/DLBCL and DLBCL, coexisting FL components was a significant predictor of inferior OS, but not PFS. Conclusions: The PFS curve of FL/DLBCL pts was similar to that of DLBCL pts, although pts with FL/DLBCL had poorer prognosis than DLBCL pts in the rituximab era. Furthermore, in our present analysis, predominant DLBCL component was predictive of neither OS nor PFS.
