    "abstract_text": "Background : Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy characterized by pathological polymerization of hemoglobin, increased red cell rigidity and poor microvascular blood flow with consequent tissue ischemia and infarction. Thus, hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion and vasculopathy are the hallmarks of its clinical presentation. The transferrin receptor (TfR) mediates the transport of iron into cells and the circulating TfR can be measured as soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR). sTfR levels are frequently used to establish the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia, especially in the context of inflammation, but they also reflect bone marrow erythropoietic activity (BMA) and mass. Erythropoietic activity has been found to be the most important determinant of sTfR levels. In this context, we aimed to study and evaluate bone marrow activity in patients with compound heterozygous HbS and beta-thalassemia (HbS/\u03b2thal) based in sTfR measurements and explore possible correlations with of key features of the disease such as: the hemolytic component, vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), acute chest syndrome, venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis including stroke, avascular necrosis, pulmonary hypertension, hydroxyurea therapy, inflammation and renal injury. along with other biomarkers of erythropoiesis and iron metabolism such as Placental Growth Factor (PlGF), Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF-15), Ferritin and Hepcidin-25. Patients and Methods : Ninety adult Caucasian patients with HbS/\u03b2thal [49 patients under hydroxyurea (HU+) treatment and 41 patients without hydroxyurea (HU-) treatment], were included in this study, while 22 apparently healthy individuals of similar age and gender served as controls. None of the patients has received any transfusions at least 6-monthes before enrollment in the study. Along with hematologic and blood chemistry parameters determination, levels of circulating sTfR, PlGF, GDF-15 and Hepcidin-25 were measured in patients with HbS/\u03b2thal and controls using RUO and IVD immunoenzymatic techniques. BMA activity was calculated from the established formula: patient-sTFR / meanControl-sTFR. Results : We found that: sTfR levels were markedly elevated in all patients with HbS/\u03b2thal compared to controls (4.8\u00b12.2 vs. 1.0\u00b10.2 mg/L, p0.434). BMA correlated significantly with the markers of the erythropoietic and hemolytic component such as: Hemoglobin (r=-0.434, p0.351 and r=-0.043, p>0.710, respectively), but a negative correlation was found between BMA and Hepcidin-25/Ferritin ratio, (r=-0.330, p=0.005). Conclusions : Our findings demonstrate that all patients with HbS/\u03b2thal studied have a significantly increased degree of erythroid BMA as assessed by measurements of sTfR levels. Erythroid BMA correlated significantly with Hepcidin/Ferritin ratio, which is an index of the degree of Hepcidin expression relative to iron overload. The correlation of erythroid BMA with Hb A levels, indicate the important role of \u03b2thal genotype in HbS/\u03b2thal disease. Furthermore, BMA is not related to hydroxyurea therapy and/or iron metabolism parameters in these patients. This implicates a likely complex action of hydroxyurea, which causes intermittent cytotoxic suppression of erythroid progenitors and cell stress signaling. The latter affects erythropoiesis, leading to recruitment of erythroid progenitors with increased HbF levels, although the number of erythroid progenitors -the main source of sTfR- remains stable.
