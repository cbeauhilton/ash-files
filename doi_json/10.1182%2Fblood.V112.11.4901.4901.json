    "abstract_text": "Objective To investigate the effects of the dendritic cell (DC) subsets and the transcriptive factors, T-bet and GATA-3, on immune imbalance in the pathogenesis of acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Methods The mDCs(HLA-DR + Lin \u2212 CD11c + ) and pDCs(HLA-DR + Lin \u2212 CD123 + ) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were measured with flow cytometry (FCM), the expressions of T-bet mRNA and GATA-3 mRNA in PBMNC with semiquantitive RT-PCR and the plasma levels of IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 with ELISA in 29 SAA patients (21 untreated and 8 recovered) and 16 healthy controls. Results The percentages of mDCs in PBMNC were (0.44\u00b10.24) % and (0.73\u00b10.30) % in untreated and recovered SAA patients respectively, either of which was higher than that of controls (0.29\u00b10.10%) ( P <0.05). The percentage of pDCs in the untreated cases was lower than that of the recovered or controls [(0.18\u00b10.14) % vs. (0.28\u00b10.20) % and (0.29\u00b10.13) %] ( P <0.05). mDCs/pDCs ratios were 3.45\u00b12.71 and 2.90\u00b10.95 in untreated and recovered groups respectively, either of which was higher than that of controls (1.15\u00b10.56) ( P <0.05). No statistical difference of mDCs/pDCs was found between untreated and recovered patients ( P <0.05). The relative mRNA expressions of transcriptive factor T-bet were 0.37\u00b10.07, 0.20\u00b10.07 and 0.17\u00b10.05 in 3 groups, respectively. The expression of T-bet of untreated patients was higher than that of recovered patients or healthy controls ( P <0.05). There was no statistical difference of GATA-3 expression among 3 groups( P >0.05). T-bet/GATA-3 ratio was 0.72\u00b10.13 in untreated patients, which was higher than that of recovered patients (0.33\u00b10.08) or controls (0.35\u00b10.11). The plasma level of IFN\u03b3 in the untreated cases was (50.9\u00b11.1)ng/L, which was higher than that of recovered [(49.7\u00b10.9) ng/L] or controls[(49.7\u00b10.7) ng/L]. There were significant positive correlation between T-bet and mDCs/pDCs ( r =0.445, P <0.01), as well as T-bet and IFN\u03b3 ( r =0.402, P <0.01). Conclusion Both mDCs/pDCs and T-bet/GATA-3 ratios in SAA were higher and positively correlated which might contribute to the cascade activation of T lymphocytes. Immunosuppressive therapy for SAA should be kept on until both ratios become normal."
