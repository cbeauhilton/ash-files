    "abstract_text": "Background: Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an aggressive lymphoma associated mainly to HIV infection, although cases in immunocompetent patients are described as well. Objective: To describe the prevalence, the clinicopathologic features and determine the overall survival of lymphoma patients according human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status. Methods: We reviewed the pathology database at Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas (INEN), the leading cancer center of Peru from 2005 to 2014. 6218 cases were lymphomas, 5031 cases were Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 3905 cases were B-cell lineage. 22 met diagnosis of PBL, 4 patients were excluded (1 prior treatment, 1 synchronous malignancy and 2 incomplete medical records). Finally, we had 18 cases for evaluation. Survival curves were estimated by Kaplan Meier. Statistical analysis was based on SPSS Program version 22. Results: The prevalence of PBL was 0.004% of all Non-Hodgkin lymphomas and 0.005% of B-cell lymphomas. 13 of 18 cases (72.2%) were HIV-positive patients (PBL-HIV+). The median age for PBL-HIV+ was 37 years (range 22-67 years) and 58 years (range 53-74 years) for HIV-negative patients (PBL-HIV-).The extra-oral primary was the most frequent primary site in both groups. The advanced stage was 80% in PBL-HIV- patients. Presence of B-symptoms and Ki-67>80% were greater in PBL-HIV- patients. CHOP or CHOP-like regimen was the common treatment in both groups, only one patient received DA-EPOCH (PBL-HIV+ group). HAART-na\u00efve patients were 77%. The median OS time was 43 months (range 1-84 months) in PBL-HIV+ patients and 13 months (range 0-15 months) in PBL-VIH- patients, the 5-yrs-OS was 26.9% y 0% respectively. Conclusions : Plasmablastic lymphoma is a rare lymphoma, either associated or not to HIV infection. Advanced and aggressive disease is a distinctive feature in both lymphomas. The PBL-HIV- has a worse prognosis with shorter overall survival compared to the PBL-HIV+ patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
