    "abstract_text": "Introduction In classical Hodgkin Disease, Reed Sternberg cells reacts with antibodies against a granulocyte associated antigen, CD15/CD30. So expression of immunochemistries CD15 and CD 30 in patients,suspecting for HD, has quite significant diagnostic value. Aim To find out relevance of CD15/CD30 expression in relation to clinical outcome in patients of Hodgkin's disease. Methods and Material A total of 301 patients of Hodgkin' disease from stage I to stage IV treated in Shaukat Khanum hospital during last 8 years, were reviewed. Data was analyzed concerning age, gender, histopathology, staging, immunochemistry and outcome. Results: Among these 301 patients, male to female ratio was 4.3:1.The mean age was 10.01years Maximum patients presented in stage III i.e 40.2 %. Total 55 (18.2%) patients were reported positive for CD 15 and 261 (86.7 %) for CD 30. Amongst CD 15 positive patients, 1.8% received palliation, 16.3% showed Primary progressive Hodgkin's lymphoma ( PPHL ),16.3% showed relapse. Amongst CD 15 negative patients, no patients received palliation, 9.47% showed PPHL, 15.7% showed relapse. Amongst CD 30 positive patients, 0.38% pts received palliation, 7.66% showed PPHL, 12.2% showed relapse. Conclusion: There is diagnostic significance of CD15/CD 30 in Hodgkin's Disease but the prognostic significance of these immunochemistries could not be proven.
