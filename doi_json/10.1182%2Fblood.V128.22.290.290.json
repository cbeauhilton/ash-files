    "abstract_text": "Background: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell malignancy that is initially responsive but ultimately relapses to frontline therapy. Ibrutinib, a first-in-class, once-daily, oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) has achieved 68% of overall response rate in relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients. However, the vast majority of MCL patients experience disease progression, demonstrating that standard-of-care approaches are failing and that a means for targeting ibrutinib resistant MCL is clinically needed. Our hypothesis is that the ibrutinib-resistant MCL may rely on the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway to produce energy for tumor growth. In this study, we investigated the effects of IACS-010759, a small molecule mitochondrial complex I inhibitor discovered in MD Anderson Cancer Center which can block the OXPHOS pathway, to overcome ibrutinib resistance in MCL in vitro and in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Methods: The OXPHOS metabolic pathways were investigated by RNASeq in a panel of ibrutinib-sensitive and -resistant MCL samples. Cell growth inhibition assays were tested after 72-hour treatment with IACS-010759 in ibrutinib-resistant MCL cell lines, Z-138 and Maver-1, and ibrutinib-sensitive MCL cell lines, Rec-1, Mino, and Jeko-1, by CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega). Furthermore, an IBN-resistant MCL PDX model was established and the therapeutic effects and tolerability of IACS-010759 were investigated in the primary MCL-bearing PDX model. Results: We have done RNA sequencing (RNASeq) in 7 primary ibrutinib-resistant and 16 ibrutinib-sensitive MCL patient samples, and analyzed the data using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software. The results demonstrated that the OXPHOS pathway was activated in the primary ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells but not ibrutinib-sensitive MCL cells. Based on the RNASeq data, we selected an OXPHOS inhibitor IACS-010759 to investigate its effects on both primary ibrutinib-resistant and ibrutinib-sensitive MCL cells in vitro and in PDX mice. IACS-010759 significantly inhibited cell proliferation in ibrutinib-resistant MCL cell lines, Z-138 and Maver-1, but not in ibrutinib-sensitive MCL cell lines, Rec-1, Mino, and Jeko-1, during a 72-hour incubation. Furthermore, the primary ibrutinib-resistant MCL PDX mice were administrated with 10 mg/kg IACS-10759 by oral gavage, for 28 days using a 5 on/2 off dosing schedule. Our data showed that IACS-010759 completely eradicated tumor growth in ibrutinib-resistant MCL PDX mice (n=5, p=0.045). All mice tolerated the treatment dose and no toxicity was found during 28 days of IACS-010759 treatment. Conclusions: The OXPHOS inhibitor IACS-010759 overcomes ibrutinib resistance both in vitro and in the PDX mouse model. The investigation of its mechanism-of-action is ongoing. IACS-010759 could have the potential for clinical use in ibrutinib-resistant relapsed/refractory MCL patients.
