    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Pts with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) are reported to have quantitative and qualitative T and NK cell dysfunction. While NK cells act through non-specific killing, T-cells are more specific. The 2 types of T-lymphocytes, CD4+ (Th; helper) and CD8+ (Ts; cytotolytic/suppressor) are subcategorized based on cytokine secretion profile upon activation. Release of different cytokines from these immune cells modulates the host response. T1 cells (Th1, Ts1) secrete IL-2 and interferon-g which initiate the Th1 response- mainly CD4+ activation along with B and T cells, leading to proliferation and differentiation of these cells. T2 (Th2, Ts2) cells initiate the Th2 response (release of TNF-a, IL-10) resulting in direct lysis of the target cell by production of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10. Hypothesis: To decipher this antitumor mechanism of L in CLL pts we investigated its effect on the efferent arm of immune response by evaluating the T cell population and the afferent response by change in expression of co-stimulatory molecules on B-CLL cells and cytokine profile in these pts treated on a phase II clinical study. Methods: CLL pts treated with L were evaluated for absolute number of T (CD4+, CD8+) and NK (CD56+) cells by flow cytometry on day before (day0) start and on Day 8 of treatment with L. Peripheral blood was collected and ficolled to obtain enriched mononuclear cells. The serum was used to study the cytokines. Activation status was determined by co-expression of CD45+. Serum cytokine profile was measured by Flow cytometry using the Luminex system. B-CLL surface co-stimulatory molecules were detected by flow cytometry and analyzed by FACS. These responses were correlated with the tumor flare (TF) reaction that the patients developed during the first week of treatment with L. Results: Eighteen out of 45 pts have so far been evaluated for immunomodulatory activity of L. There were 2 complete responders (CRs) and 6 partial responders (PRs); while 4 had stable disease (SD), 4 were clinically unevaluable and 2 were too early for response in this group. Mean baseline (bl) NK cell count pretreatment was 251 (range 31\u20131510) vs. post treatment was 193 (range 6\u201313,482). Six out of 18 patients showed an increase, ranging from 20 \u2212199% in the absolute NK (CD16+/CD56+/CD45+). While there was no appreciable change in CD4+ numbers there was a general trend in increase of CD8+ cells. No change in monocyte population was noted. Concurrent increase in the expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD95 and CD80 was noted. This response in co-stimulation was confirmed by in vitro experiments done on isolated B-CLL cells (n=4)treated with L. An increase in Th-2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10 was noted in all eight responders, while VEGF levels were decreased in 6/18 patients. 99% of patients had a TF and the grade of TF correlated with the changes in T cells and cytokine profile. Conclusion: It appears that in vivo L is able to orchestrate an anti-tumor response in CLL by modulating the NK cells, changing the cytokine profile and up-regulating co-stimulatory molecules. This change in the immune effector cell repertoire and the Th2 skewing may explain the initial flare reaction noted in these L treated pts. Data from these correlative studies is being evaluated in the context of the phase II clinical trial to be reported at the 48 th ASH annual meeting."
