    "abstract_text": "Previously, we demonstrated that enforced activation of STAT5 in human cord blood (CB)-derived stem/progenitor cells results in enhanced long-term stem cell self-renewal and impaired myelopoiesis ( J.J.Schuringa et al, J.Exp.Med . 2004 ; 200 : 623 ). Now, C/EBP\u03b1 was identified as a critical transcription factor that is downregulated by STAT5. Affymetrix microarray analysis on STAT5A(1*6)-transduced CD34 + cells identified C/EBP\u03b1 as the most prominently downregulated gene (\u22123.3 fold), and these data were confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. To determine the cell-biological relevance of these observations, a 4-OHT-inducible C/EBP\u03b1-ER protein was co-expressed with the STAT5A(1*6) mutant in CB CD34 + cells by using a retroviral approach. Re-expression of C/EBP\u03b1 in STAT5A(1*6) cells resulted in a marked restoration of myelopoiesis as determined by morphological analyses, FACS analyses for myeloid markers such as CD11b, CD14 and CD15, and RT-PCR for myeloid-restricted genes such as g-csfr. While enforced activation of STAT5A resulted in accelerated erythropoiesis, this was blocked when C/EBP\u03b1 was re-introduced into STAT5A(1*6) cells. Similarly, the proliferative advantage imposed on CD34 + cells by STAT5A(1*6) depended on the downmodulation of C/EBP as reintroduction of C/EBP\u03b1 in these cells induced a quick cell cycle arrest and the onset of myeloid differentiation. At the stem/progenitor cell level, LTC-IC frequencies were elevated from 0.5% to 11% by STAT5A(1*6) as compared to controls, but these elevated LTC-IC frequencies were strongly reduced when C/EBP\u03b1 was reintroduced in STAT5A(1*6) cells. Enumeration of progenitors in methylcellulose assays revealed similar results, the number of CFCs was reduced over 10-fold when C/EBP\u03b1 was expressed in STAT5A(1*6) cells. Also, secondary CAFCs and long-term cultures could only be generated from STAT5A(1*6) expressing cells, but not from cells that co-expressed STAT5A(1*6) and C/EBP\u03b1. Taken together, these data indicate that STAT5-induced self-renewal and impaired myelopoiesis involves downmodulation of C/EBP\u03b1.",
