    "abstract_text": "Platelets have long been proposed to play a role in fostering neoplasias, ranging from tissue repair to cancer, but clinical evidence remains limited. Since available therapautics antagonizing hemostatic platelet functions lead to bleeding, the concept of targeting platelets in the context of cancer prevention or treatment has not been pursued in controlled clinical trials. To address this, we developed a novel antiplatelet strategy by partial inhibition of thrombopoiesis. We hypothesized that if platelets played a key role in fostering neoplastic malignancies, controlled platelet count reduction within a safe range would slow platelet-dependent cancer progression without adversely affecting hemostasis. Since the MPL ligand megakaryocyte growth and development factor (thrombopoietin, MGDF) is required for maintenance of normal platelet count, and the liver is responsible only for a portion of thrombopoietin synthesis, we tested this hypothesis by targeted knock-down of hepatic thrombopoietin synthesis using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) in mammary cancer-prone transgenic mice. We investigated whether partial reduction of thrombopoietin sythesis through ASO knock-down was hemostatically safe and impacted kinetics or penetrance of neoplastic progression in de novo mammary carcinogenesis in MMTV-PyMT mice. We designed and generated thrombopoietin ASO-s (TPO ASO) to achieve about 50% platelet count reduction in mice by inhibition of hepatic thrombopoietin gene expression. Then MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice were subcutaneously administered one of the effective TPO ASO-s, with treatment initiated at 40 days of age and before appearance of palpable (>2.0 mm) mammary tumors. We assessed the impact of saturating dose TPO ASO, including platelet count, plasma TPO level, and number of megakaryocytes in the femoral bone marrow. Mammary tumor growth, pulmonary metastases, and overall survival (fixed end-point study based on total tumor burden) of TPO ASO-treated mice were compared with untreated controls. At study endpoints, mammary carcinomas, platelet deposition, intra-tumoral vessel density, and Ki-67 positive cells were quantitatively evaluated. As anticipated from the drug screen, TPO ASO treatment at saturating effect reduced plasma thrombopoietin levels and blood platelet count by ~50% within 4 weeks, and the number of megakaryocytes in femoral bone marrow. TPO ASO also suppressed primary tumor growth (attached figure) and impaired development of pulmonary metastases (p<0.05), resulting in increased overall survival (p<0.001). Histological analysis of primary tumors revealed that TPO ASO significantly reduced mean platelet deposition in tumor vessels (from 54% to 26%; p<0.001), reduced vessel density (from 3.1% area to 1.5% area; p<0.05) and Ki-67 positive cells (from 62/field to 36/field; p<0.05) in primary tumors. Together, these results support the notion that strategies that safely reduce platelet presence or activity within developing mammary tumors, may limit neoplastic progression coincident with reduced angiogenesis. In summary, we found that TPO ASO reduces thrombopoietin levels and platelet count within the hemostatically safe range and significantly slows neoplastic progression of spontaneous mammary carcinomas in MMTV-PyMT mice. Overall, pharmacological knockdown of hepatic TPO synthesis is a new antiplatelet strategy that may be reasonably safe and effective in various platelet-driven disorders, including cancer.
