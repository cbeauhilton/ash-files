    "abstract_text": "Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare clonal myeloproliferative disorder of early childhood. Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation can induce long-term remissions, relapse rates remain high, and innovative approaches are needed. Since donor lymphocyte infusion in JMML is efficacious, T cell mediated immunotherapy may be effective, and appropriate antigenic targets must be identified. One candidate tumor-associated antigen for the immunotherapy of JMML is \u03b3-globin, which is expressed at high levels in most JMML patients. Most clonogenic JMML cells constitutively express this onco-fetal protein, which is not necessary for the normal erythropoesis of children and adults. To determine whether \u03b3-globin can serve as a target for immunotherapy in JMML, we sought to determine whether \u03b3-globin is naturally processed and presented by the HLA complex. Using conventional bioinformatic techniques and the T2 binding assay to predict candidate epitopes, we identified 4 \u03b3-globin derived peptides (g031, g071, g105, and g106) that were predicted to bind to the HLA-A2 molecule in vitro . Since this strategy provides no evidence for which predicted epitopes are processed and presented by tumor cells in vivo , we employed a biochemical strategy to determine which peptides are naturally processed and presented. This step is critical in certifying that a candidate peptide epitope is an appropriate target for immunotherapy treatments. Using our K562-derived artificial APC (aAPC), an APC that expresses A2 and no other HLA allele, we introduced the EGFP-\u03b3-globin fusion gene. We then acid stripped peptides directly from the surface of one billion aAPC/EGFP-\u03b3-globin cells without subjecting the cells to detergent mediated lysis. Peptides less than 5 kDa in size were fractionated by reverse phased HPLC analysis and analyzed by mass spectrometry. We identified two mass spectrometry peaks which corresponded to \u03b3-globin derived peptides, g031 and g105. Of these, the identity of one peak, g105, was successfully confirmed by peptide sequencing, providing strong evidence that g105 is naturally processed and presented by aAPC/EGFP-\u03b3-globin cells. Next, to confirm that g105 is processed and presented by primary JMML cells, we generated \u03b3-globin specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL) from A2 positive healthy donors using synthetic g105 peptide. \u03b3-Globin specific CTL were able to specifically cytolyze A2+ \u03b3-globin+ JMML cells but not A2+ \u03b3-globin- JMML cells. Specific cytotoxicity was blocked by anti-A2 mAb but not isotype control. These results show for the first time that the \u03b3-globin derived peptide, g105, can serve as a target epitope for the CTL directed immunotherapy of JMML. Furthermore, these results illustrate an innovative aAPC based strategy that can identify the antigenic peptide epitopes of putative tumor associated antigens that are naturally processed by tumor cells, presented via HLA class I, and can serve as targets for effective anti-cancer immunotherapy.",
