    "abstract_text": "Ectopic delivery of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) to megakaryocytes (Mk) represents a viable approach for localized tenase generation by effectively concentrating the FVIIIa/FIXa enzyme-cofactor complex onto the negatively-charged phospholipid surface of activated platelets. While phenotypic correction has been demonstrated using hemophilia A (FVIII \u2212/\u2212 ) murine models in vivo , the activation state of platelet FVIII (pFVIII), optimal promoter choice, and phenotypic correction in the setting of a thrombocytotic stimulus remain unestablished. Preliminary microarray experiments using human platelets (N=5) demonstrated that the Mk-specific platelet factor 4 (PF4) transcripts were among the most abundant, prompting use of the 1.1 Kb PF4 promoter for Mk/platelet-restricted expression of human B-domain-deleted (hBDD) FVIII within the background of an exon 17-deleted mouse model of hemophilia A (PF4/hBDD/FVIII \u2212/\u2212 ). A chromogenic tenase assay using gel-filtered platelets from PF4/hBDD/FVIII \u2212/\u2212 mice confirmed the presence of functional FVIII equivalent to 73 mU\u00b71x10 9 platelets\u00b7mL \u22121 (N = 10 mice). In contrast, FVIII was not detectable in PF4/hBDD/FVIII \u2212/\u2212 plasma (assay sensitivity <20 pM) or in platelets from FVIII \u2212/\u2212 mice. The ectopic pFVIII did not affect the release and/or function of other a-granule storage proteins as established by parallel measurements of platelet factor V (FV) using a prothrombinase assay. Paired tenase assays (\u00b1 thrombin) confirmed that pFVIII (unlike pFV) required thrombin cleavage for complete activation. To delineate the effects of a thrombocytotic stimulus on pFVIII expression and/or function, PF4/hBDD/FVIII \u2212/\u2212 (N = 10) or FVIII \u2212/\u2212 control mice (N = 5) were injected with thrombopoietin (TPO; 10\u03bcg/kg/day for 5 days) resulting in an 87% average increase in platelet count. Day 10 tenase assay of TPO-injected PF4/hBDD/FVIII \u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated a 66% reduction in pFVIII activity (25 mU FVIII\u00b71x10 9 platelets\u00b7mL \u22121 ), unassociated with altered expression of a-granule-stored amyloid-b-precursor protein (AbPP) as a control for storage granule content; plasmatic FVIII remained undetectable. In contrast, the decrease in total platelet FVIII biomass was less pronounced in TPO-treated PF4/hBDD/FVIII \u2212/\u2212 mice, representing a 35% reduction from 147.6 mU to 96 mU after TPO stimulation. The decreased pFVIII in TPO-stimulated PF4/hBDD/FVIII \u2212/\u2212 mice correlated with loss of phenotypic correction as evaluated using tail bleeding survival rates: wild-type mice (100%; N= 5), FVIII \u2212/\u2212 (0%; N=5), PF4/hBDD/FVIII \u2212/\u2212 (TPO-nai\u0308ve 60%; N=11), PF4/hBDD/FVIII \u2212/\u2212 (TPO-treated 0%; N=7) (p value between PF4/hBDD/FVIII \u2212/\u2212 mice with and without TPO stimulation = 0.002). While these data establish that Mk-directed pFVIII (unlike pFV) is proteolytically inactive upon platelet activation, they also imply that thrombocytotic stimuli negatively affect the pFVIII bioavailability and phenotypic efficacy. As importantly, the hemostatic efficacy of platelet FVIII correlates best with localized platelet FVIII delivery (FVIII concentration/platelet) and not the systemic platelet FVIII bioavailability."
