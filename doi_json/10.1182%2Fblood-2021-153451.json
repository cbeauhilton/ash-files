    "abstract_text": "Background: The PTCL are a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas originating from mature T-lymphocytes. They are aggressive diseases, often resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Despite the fact that a number of new agents have been approved, treatment paradigms tailored to the biology of the disease have yet to emerge. Tolinapant (ASTX660) is a potent antagonist of both cellular and X-linked inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (cIAP1/2 and XIAP), and is presently in phase I/II trials in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas (NCT02503423). IAP antagonists enhance tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily mediated apoptosis (Ward GA, et al. Mol Cancer Ther. 2018), are potent anti-tumor immune enhancers and induce markers of immunogenic cell death such as damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs; Ye W, et al, Oncoimmunology, 2020). Objectives: We explored the sensitivity of a range of T-cell lymphoma (TCL) cell lines to tolinapant. We establish the synergy coefficient between tolinapant and the HDAC inhibitor, romidepsin, and interrogated the molecular basis of their synergistic interaction. Methods: A panel of human T-cell lymphoma cell lines were tested in proliferation assays (CellTiterGlo) for sensitivity to tolinapant in the presence or absence of 10ng/ml of TNF alpha. For combination studies, with tolinapant and romidepsin, each drug was tested at the IC10 and IC40 concentrations in the presence or absence of TNF alpha. Synergy scores using the Excess over Bliss (EOB) model were calculated using SynergyFinder (Aleksandr Ianevski et al; Nucleic Acids Research, 2020). Additionally, the effects of tolinapant and romidepsin on the IAPs and caspases were analyzed by western blots. TNFR1 receptor expression and induction of DAMPs were also analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: TCL Lines demonstrated varying sensitivities to tolinapant in the presence or absence of TNF alpha. The most sensitive cell lines, ALK+ ALCL and SUP-M2, had IC50 concentrations ranging from 200nM \u00b1 100nM to 20nM \u00b1 1nM in the absence or presence of TNF alpha, respectively, at 24, 48 and 72hrs, while a resistant CTCL cell line HH had an IC50 concentration of over 20mM, even in the presence of TNF alpha. Interestingly, using western blot analysis, we found that the presence of TNF alpha increased the levels of cIAP1 in the tolinapant sensitive SUP-M2 cell line, but not in the resistant HH cell line. However, there was a concentration dependent decrease in cIAP1 but not in XIAP in both cell lines treated with tolinapant. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that tolinapant increases the expression of TNFR1 and DAMPs in a dose dependent manner on the sensitive SUP-M2, but not in the resistant HH cells. In combination experiments, using the EOB model, tolinapant plus romidepsin was found to be synergistic in the absence of TNF alpha, at 36hrs, in both the sensitive cell line SUP-M2 and the resistant cell line HH. In the presence of TNF alpha, synergism was seen only in the sensitive cell line SUP-M2 and antagonistic in the HH cell line (Fig. 3). In the tolinapant plus romidepsin treated samples, cIAP1 levels decreased in the SUP-M2 cell line, in the absence of TNF alpha, however, addition of TNF alpha did not alter the levels of cIAP1 in the SUP-M2 cells. The cIAP1 levels decreased in the HH cells treated with the combination, in both the presence or absence of TNF alpha (Figure). Our findings indicate that the synergy of the tolinapant plus romidepsin is not dependent on the presence of TNF alpha. Conclusion: Tolinapant has demonstrated potent cytotoxic effects against a broad range of TCL lines both as a monotherapy and in combination with the HDAC Inhibitor, romidepsin. In in vitro studies, T cell lymphoma cell lines demonstrated varying sensitivity to tolinapant with certain cell lines being more resistant, even in the presence of TNF alpha. Interestingly, the addition of romidepsin appeared to overcome the intrinsic resistance to tolinapant in the absence of TNF alpha. These data provide the rationale to continue to explore the combination of tolinapant and romidepsin in vivo and to investigate additional combinations with T-cell specific agents (e.g. pralatrexate, belinostat, azacitidine and decitabine).
