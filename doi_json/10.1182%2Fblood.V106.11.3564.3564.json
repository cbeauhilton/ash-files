    "abstract_text": "One pathway that mediates the rapid removal of transfused platelets exposed to cold for short periods (\u2264 2 h) is the clustering of the von-Willebrand factor (VWF) receptor complex. Clustered VWF receptors are recognized by the \u03b1M\u03b22 integrin on hepatic macrophages, which, through its lectin domain, binds exposed \u03b2N-acetylglucosamine (\u03b2GlcNAc) residues on the clustered GPIb\u03b1 subunits ( Cell  112 : 87 , 2003 ). Coverage of the exposed \u03b2GlcNAc residues by galactosylation prevents clearance of platelets from the circulation. We have now investigated detailed changes of the VWF complex on platelets during short (\u2264 2 h) and prolonged refrigeration (\u2265 48 h). The VWF receptor structure in chilled and rewarmed platelets was probed by flow cytometry using a panel of mAbs directed towards the GPIb\u03b1 N-terminal (N\u2013T) and GPIX (FITC-AN51 (aa36\u201359), PE-Cy5-HIP1 (aa59\u201381), FITC-SZ2 (aa268\u2013282), and PE-GPIX mAb). Binding of the anti-GPIb\u03b1 mAbs HIP1 and SZ2 as well as the anti-GPIX was diminished 40\u201350 % following 0.5 h of cooling when compared with room temperature (RT) platelets. The anti -GPIb\u03b1 N-T mAb AN51 bound similarly to cooled and RT platelets. In contrast, the binding of all anti-VWF complex mAbs was decreased by 50\u201360 % after refrigeration of platelets in plasma for 48 h when compared to fresh RT platelets. Immunoblots demonstrated that loss of binding did not result from GPIb\u03b1 shedding. VWF and fibrinogen binding were also increased by ~ 5 % or ~ 20 %, respectively, and P-selectin exposure increased by ~ 30 % in 48 h refrigerated platelets compared to the RT platelets stored for 48 h as determined by flow cytometry. These results suggest that the conformation of the VWF receptor is altered by long term refrigeration which leads to VWF binding and partial platelet activation. Loss of antibody binding is not simply due to GPIb\u03b1 clustering as incubation of platelets with 5 \u03bcM latrunculin A for 1 h, which induces profound GPIb\u03b1 clustering, increased binding by ~ 30 % compared to untreated platelets, but did not alter the diminished mAb binding to platelets induced by chilling. Refrigerated (\u2264 14 days) platelets still adhere well to collagen-coated surfaces under flow (1000 seconds \u22121 for 2 min) demonstrating that VWF receptor function remains intact. We conclude that refrigeration of platelets in plasma for \u2265 48 h induces both conformational changes and clustering of the VWF complex, to prime it for activation by inducing VWF binding.",
