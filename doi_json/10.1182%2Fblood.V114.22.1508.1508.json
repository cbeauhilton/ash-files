    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1508 Poster Board I-531 Developmental hematopoiesis satisfies the immediate needs of the embryo and provides the hematopoietic stem cells necessary for lifelong blood homeostasis. Recently, the mid-gestation mouse placenta was identified as an important definitive hematopoietic organ; data from us and others indicates that the human placenta functions analogously, harboring and potentially generating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The function of the human placenta in embryonic hematopoiesis has not been addressed. We assessed the hematopoietic potential of placental tissues before the onset of feto-placental circulation and found robust de novo generation of clonogenic progenitors. Interestingly, pre-circulation progenitors were greatly enriched (69 \u00b1 14% of total) in macrophage progenitors. Immunostaining demonstrated that these progenitors are generated in the chorionic plate. As development progresses, placental macrophages migrate to the villous stroma. Surprisingly, in the villi, placental macrophages associate closely with an unexpected population of extravascular, z-globin + primitive erythroid cells, prompting the hypothesis that embryonic macrophages promote the maturation of primitive erythroblasts in the placenta. Concordantly, we found that human primitive erythroblasts enucleate, as has been recently demonstrated in mice. Interestingly, the first enucleated erythroid cells were found in the villous stroma; between 5-7 weeks developmental age, their relative frequency in the stroma was 2-4 fold higher than in lumens. We also observed free nuclei in the placental stroma; a similar population of ejected red cell nuclei, termed pyrenocytes, has recently been described in mouse embryos. Immunohistochemistry and FACS confirmed that these free nuclei in the placenta were pyrenocytes. Electron microscopy revealed placental macrophages containing ingested red cell nuclei. Together, this data suggests that placenta-derived macrophages promote the terminal maturation of primitive erythroblasts in the villous stroma, nominating the first trimester human placenta as a site of primitive hematopoiesis.
