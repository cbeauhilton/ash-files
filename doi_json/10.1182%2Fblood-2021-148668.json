    "abstract_text": "Background: Despite the demonstrated efficacy of ruxolitinib (potent and selective Janus kinase [JAK] 1 and JAK2 inhibitor) in patients with MF, inadequate responses or loss of response to ruxolitinib may occur, possibly due to persistent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway with chronic ruxolitinib therapy. Parsaclisib (INCB050465) is a potent and highly selective next-generation PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor. We previously demonstrated preliminary efficacy in a phase 2 trial (INCB 50465-201, NCT02718300) of parsaclisib added to stable doses of ruxolitinib for patients with MF who experienced a suboptimal response to ruxolitinib. JAK inhibitors, including ruxolitinib, are associated with thrombocytopenia; therefore, patients with low platelet counts (PC) are traditionally more difficult to treat. We present the efficacy and safety subgroup analysis of this ongoing study in patients grouped by baseline PC. Methods: Eligible adults had primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) MF with suboptimal response (palpable spleen >10 cm below left subcostal margin, or palpable splenomegaly 5-10 cm below left subcostal margin and presence of 1 symptom score \u22655 or 2 symptom scores \u22653 each using the Screening Symptom Form) after \u22656 months of ruxolitinib monotherapy (5-25 mg twice daily, stable dose for \u22658 weeks). Patients remained on their last stable ruxolitinib dose and received add-on parsaclisib 10 mg or 20 mg once-daily (QD) for 8 weeks and the same dose once-weekly thereafter (daily to weekly group), or parsaclisib 5 mg or 20 mg QD for 8 weeks and 5 mg QD thereafter (all daily group). For the subgroup analysis, patients were grouped by baseline PC (\u2265100\u00d710 9 /L, higher PC or 50-<100\u00d710 9 /L, low PC). Key objectives were to evaluate the impact of baseline PC on spleen volume (SV) and total symptom score (TSS) as assessed by Myelofibrosis-Symptoms Assessment Form (MFSAF) v3.0 daily diary at week 12 and week 24, and safety. Results: At data cutoff (Aug 27, 2020), 67 patients were enrolled, 21 with low PC and 46 with higher PC. Median age of both groups was 68 years, and median prior duration of ruxolitinib use was 34.7 months for low PC and 14.9 months for higher PC. Patients with low PC had higher baseline symptoms (MFSAF-TSS median [range], 21.4 [0.6-47]) than patients with higher PC (MFSAF-TSS, 10 [0-43]). Responder analysis for SV reduction (SVR) is summarized in Table 1 . At week 12, slightly more patients with low PC achieved \u226510% SVR compared with patients with higher PC, whereas, at week 24, responses were similar between the 2 groups. Of patients with at least 10% SVR at week 24, 4 of 6 with low PC and 9 of 13 with higher PC were receiving all daily dose regimens. Median (range) percentage change in MFSAF-TSS was \u221220.5 (\u221256.6 to +17.1) and \u221222.2 (\u2212100 to +500) at week 12, and \u221226.1 (\u221254.7 to +2.4) and \u221223.1 (\u221291.3 to +222.5) at week 24, for patients with low PC and higher PC, respectively. Overall for both baseline platelet groups, nonhematologic treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were primarily grade 1/2. Most common (\u226520%) TEAEs were dyspnea (33%), falls (33%), peripheral edema (29%), and nasal congestion (24%) for patients in the low PC group, and diarrhea (28%), nausea (24%), abdominal pain (24%), cough (20%), and fatigue (20%) for patients with higher PC. Interruption of parsaclisib due to thrombocytopenia was observed in 9 of the 21 patients (43%) with low PC and 3 of the 46 patients (7%) with higher PC. One patient with low PC had thrombocytopenia leading to ruxolitinib interruption. Conclusion: Add-on parsaclisib demonstrated promising preliminary efficacy in patients with MF experiencing suboptimal response to ruxolitinib monotherapy. In a subgroup analysis by baseline PC, responses for SV and MFSAF-TSS reduction were similar in both groups, indicating that patients with low PC can also tolerate and benefit from this treatment combination. Phase 3 trials in ruxolitinib-experienced and ruxolitinib-naive patients are underway to further assess the combination of JAK and PI3K inhibitors.
