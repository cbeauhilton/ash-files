    "abstract_text": "Contact between chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and accessory stromal cells in tissue microenvironments is considered to play a major role in regulating CLL cell survival and disease progression. Stromal cells of various origins and species, and variable stromal-CLL cell ratios have been used in the past to study CLL-stromal cell interactions and to assess cell-adhesion mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR). Because of the heterogeneity of the currently used in vitro systems to study CLL-MSC interactions, and the importance of these co-culture systems for development and testing of novel agents, we tested a panel of murine and human MSC lines for their capacities to support CLL cell survival and CAM-DR, using various CLL-MSC ratios and fludarabine (F-ara-A) to induce CLL cell apoptosis. We tested four murine, non-transformed MSC lines derived from bone marrow: M210B4, KUM4, ST-2 and KUSA-H1. Also, we tested three human transformed cell lines: Stroma-NKtert, derived from bone marrow and immortalized by human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), UE6E7-T2 derived from bone marrow and transformed with human papilloma viruses (HPV) E6, E7 and hTERT, and UCB408E6E7Tert33 derived from umbilical cord blood and transformed with hTERT and HPV E6, E7. CLL cells were isolated from peripheral blood of untreated patients and each cell line was tested with at least three different patients according to the following protocol: viability of CLL was tested after 24, 48 and 72 hours by flow cytometry after staining with DiOC 6 and propidium iodide. The following conditions were assayed on each of the MSC lines: CLL cells in suspension culture, CLL cells in suspension culture with 10 mM F-ara-A, CLL cells in co-culture with MSC, and CLL cells in co-culture with MSC and with 10 mM F-ara-A. Firstly, we performed titration experiments in order to identify the most appropriate ratio between stromal and CLL cells, using CLL-MSC ratios of 5:1, 10:1, 20:1, 50:1 and 100:1. We found a decline in MSC-derived CLL cell protection at the highest ratio of 100:1, suggesting that ratios of 50:1 or lower provide optimal conditions for in vitro assays. Results shown in Table 1 were assayed using a 20:1 ratio and represented relative viabilities when compared to untreated controls (mean\u00b1SEM). Regarding the protective effect of different MSC, we found that all MSC lines demonstrated remarkable protection of CLL cells from spontaneous and F-ara-A-induced apoptosis. We also found that stromal cells that had round shape morphology and easily formed confluent monolayer (M210B4, KUSA-H1, Stroma-NKTert) showed more prolonged protective effect in comparison to cell lines with more spindle shaped morphology (ST-2, KUM4, UE6E7-T2). The failure of UE6E7-T2 and UCB408E6E7Tert33 to demonstrate long-term protection of CLL cells could be related to their own sensitivity to F-ara-A. In this comparative study we demonstrated that both murine and human MSC provide substantial and comparable levels of protection from spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis. CLL:MSC ratios of 50:1 or lower can be considered ideal for co-culture experiments. Further experiments have to be done to determine the levels of MSC-derived protection in a larger series of CLL samples and in different laboratories for validation. Collectively, in these co-culture assays we can study CLL-MSC interactions and CLL drugs under more standardized conditions that may allow us to evaluate the efficacy of new treatments that target the CLL microenvironment.
