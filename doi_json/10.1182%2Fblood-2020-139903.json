    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: BPDCN is a rare, aggressive hematologic malignancy characterized by poor overall survival and limited therapeutic options. Overexpression of CD123 (IL-3R\u03b1) is present in all BPDCN cases, therefore establishing this marker as a rational target for therapeutic intervention. Despite the recent approval of tagraxofusp-erzs (Pemmaraju NEJM 2019), outcomes remain poor in the setting of R/R BPDCN. IMGN632 is a CD123-targeting ADC, comprised of a high affinity anti-CD123 antibody coupled to a DNA-alkylating payload of the novel IGN class. Preclinically, BPDCN patient-derived xenografts demonstrated high sensitivity to IMGN632 (Zhang 2018, Kovtun 2018), establishing a rationale for the clinical evaluation of IMGN632 in this patient population. AIMS: Safety and efficacy of single agent IMGN632 in patients with R/R BPDCN. METHODS: Adult patients with R/R BPDCN with no more than three prior lines of therapy were eligible. IMGN632 was administered IV at 0.045 mg/kg on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. RESULTS: 23 patients with R/R BPDCN; median age of 73 years [19-82]; 74% male. Fifty-two percent of patients had at least 2 prior therapies, 52% had received prior intensive therapies (eg HyperCVAD, FLAG, CHOP), 22% had prior allogeneic stem cell transplant, and importantly 43% had prior exposure to tagraxofusp-erzs (n=10). At enrollment, 70% had skin involvement, 61% had bone marrow involvement, and 48% had lymph node involvement. The most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) include: nausea (35% all grade; 0% grade 3+), peripheral edema (26% all grade; 0% grade 3+), and infusion related reactions (22% all grade; 4% grade 3+). There were no Grade 3+ treatment-related AEs observed in >1 patient. No capillary leak syndrome (CLS) was reported; grade 3+ LFT elevations, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were all noted in 1 patient each, and there were no deaths within 30-days after last IMGN632 dose. Seven of 23 patients had an objective response (2 CR, 2 CRc, 1 CRi and 2 PR) for an ORR of 30% (95% CI 13-53%) and a composite complete remission rate of 22%. The duration of response (DOR including time from PR) for the four CR/CRc patients were 9.2, 6.8+, 3.1 and 3+ months without transplantation (Figure 1A). Examples of responses are shown in Figure 1B-D. Of note, among the 10 patients with prior exposure to tagraxofusp (none had achieved a CR with tagraxofusp), 30% (n=3) achieved an objective response to IMGN632 (1 CR, 1 CRi, 1 PR). Two remarkable responders had received 3 prior regimens including tagraxofusp followed by intense and other therapies (CLAG-M/CLAG; or CHOP/allogeneic transplant/decitabine with venetoclax) and presented with diffuse disease involvement with skin, nodal, and bone marrow infiltration. After 1 and 2 doses respectively, both patients cleared all three disease compartments (CR/CRi) with one remaining in CR for 9.2 months. Additionally, among 12 patients who had bone marrow involvement and response assessment, 75% (9 of 12) had a reduction in bone marrow blasts, and 50% (6 of 12) achieved a bone marrow complete remission (<5% blasts, grey bars), including 3 patients with prior tagraxofusp. (Figure 1E). CONCLUSION: The current available therapy for patients with R/R BPDCN has limited efficacy and significant safety and tolerability concerns that underscore the high unmet need for this patient population. In heavily pretreated R/R BPDCN patients, including patients who had progressed following tagraxofusp, intense chemotherapies and transplant, IMGN632 demonstrated a 30% (n=7) ORR, with 4 CR/CRc responses with notable DORs. In addition, IMGN632 demonstrated a favorable safety profile that included limited grade 3+ TEAEs/SAEs, no cases of CLS, and no deaths. In addition, IMGN632 is given once every 3 weeks, without the need for hospitalization. This clinical trial represents the largest-to-date prospective group of uniformly treated patients with R/R BPDCN and demonstrates promising activity and favorable tolerability in a cohort of heavily pretreated patients, including nearly half with prior anti-CD123 targeted therapy.
