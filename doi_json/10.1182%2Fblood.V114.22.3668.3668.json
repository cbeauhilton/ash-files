    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3668 Poster Board III-604 Increasing evidence suggests that B lymphocytes play a central role in inhibiting the immune response against certain tumors, but the underlying mechanisms by which B cells facilitate tumor growth are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how the presence or absence of B cells affects expansion and function of T- regulatory cells (\u2018Tregs\u2019) in a murine tumor model (EMT-6). We compared tumor growth, and the number and function of T- regs cells in wild type immune competent mice ( ICM), B cell deficient mice ( BCDM) and /or in BALB-C mice following B- cell depletion induced by injection of anti murine CD20 antibodies (mCD20 Ab, 18B12, mouse IgG1,k, Biogen-IDEC) Mice were either tumor-nai\u0308ve or implanted with EMT6 mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Absence of B cells as in BCDM completely inhibited tumor growth in the majority of mice, while B cell depletion in normal mice substantially slowed the growth of EMT-6 tumors compared to wild type mice (ICM). Substantial T regs expansion, as defined by CD4+/CD25+/FOXP3+ cells, was evident on day 26 post tumor inoculation in EMT-6 tumor bearing ICM in comparison to the non- tumor bearing mice ( 15.2 +/\u2212 1.2. % and 11.9 +/\u2212 1.1% respectively), isolated from spleen as compared to nai\u0308ve or tumor bearing BCDM (10.1+/\u2212 0.2% and 10.8+/\u2212 1.2%) The percentage and absolute number of T-regs in the spleen, tumor draining lymph nodes and tumor bed were significantly reduced in the BCDM and/or B cell depleted ICM compared to tumor bearing ICM (10%+/\u22120.8, 13.9+/\u2212 1.23% and 17+/\u2212 1.3% respectively p<0.01. data from single cell suspensions isolated from spleens on day 20 post tumor inoculation). Similar effects of B cell depletion on the numbers of T-regs were observed in the setting of pre-established EMT6 mammary tumors. In contrast to tumor bearing mice, differences in T-reg number and function were minimal in tumor free B cell deficient or in B cell depleted nai\u0308ve mice compared to ICM. T-reg function, measured by suppression assay and proliferation assays, was also markedly reduced in tumor bearing BCDM compared to ICM. Combining B cell and T-reg depletion using i.p. injection of anti CD 25 antibody (PC61 or PBS) resulted in similar rates of tumor regression in B cell depleted mice as were seen in BCDM suggesting that the combination of B cells depletion and further depletion of Tregs augmented anti-tumor response. In conclusion, our studies indicate that B cell depletion may play a useful role in augmenting the T cell anti-tumor response, in part due to their effects on T-regulatory cell biology.
