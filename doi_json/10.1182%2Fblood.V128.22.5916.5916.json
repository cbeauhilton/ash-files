    "abstract_text": "Many countries can not provide yet an adequate haemophilia care for their patients. Albania is among the countries that are trying now to improve its healthcare system but still do not have fully implemented it. As to the Haemophilia treatment the need of FVIII for patients exceeds the available resources thus jeopardizing the possibilities of having I place prophilaxis and/or major chirurgic treatments. Tuscany is one of the region in Italy where the rate of Albanian inhabitant people is higher. Among them many are also blood donors and the links between Italians and the Albanian community are quite strong as well as the Tuscany commitment toward Albania in the general health system (many are the programs put in place by the International Health Cooperation of Tuscany). In this context in 2013 a joint program between Hospital Mother Teresa in Tirana and Hospital Meyer in Florence was undersigned for the supply of 3 MIU of FVIII at 9 cents/I.U. from donors of the region each year for three years. Albania recognizes that hemophilia treatment is a urgent part of their healthcare plan and expects to be able soon to provide more funds to continue this program. Albania has been offered more FVIII from Italian donors for at least a 5 years period in the framework of an Italian recent law that is encouraging the use of FVIII in excess to Italian needs for other countries and with the support of Kedrion , who Is the company fractionating the plasma from Tuscany donors into finished product. Kedrion not only committed to pay for the shipping of goods from Italy to Albania but it is also acting as a partner and liaison between Tuscany and the country Industry should take note that with local philanthropy and financial support from the biologic industry one can achieve both improving healthcare and not just donating product but working with developing countries to make them support their population.
