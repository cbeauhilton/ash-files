    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2443 Background: There is strong and consistent evidence that a genetic component contributes to the etiology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A recent genome-wide association (GWA) study of CLL identified genetic variants located on chromosomes 2q13, 2q37.1, 6p25, 11q24, 15q23, and 19q13 that increased the risk of CLL within a European population. We replicated 5 of these 6 loci in an independent sample of CLL cases and controls from the United States. We now investigate whether these loci also influences MBL, a reported precursor condition of CLL. In addition, a follow-up analysis of the initial GWA study identified four more CLL-susceptibility loci on 2q37.3, 8q24.21, 15q21.3, and 16q24.1. Herein, we also evaluate the association of these four loci with risk of CLL. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from three ongoing studies: the Genetic Epidemiology CLL (GEC) Consortium, the Mayo Clinic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)/ CLL study, and the Mayo Clinic Biobank. We implemented rigorous genotyping quality-control measures, and successfully genotyped a total of 407 CLL patients, 965 controls, and 60 MBLs from these studies. Within each locus, the previously reported single nucleotide variants (SNPs) or variants in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the previously reported SNPs were evaluated with risk of MBL or CLL. Tests for association was done using the Cochran-Armitage trend test, and unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CLL or MBL risk Results: In our evaluation of the six initially reported CLL-susceptibility loci (2q13, 2q37.1, 6p25, 11q24, 15q23, and 19q13) with MBL risk, we found three of the six had suggestive associations (p-value < 0.20) with ORs comparable to and in the same direction as those observed from CLL risk. Our strongest finding was with rs13397985 at locus 2q37.1 (OR= 1.56; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.31; p-trend = 0.041), followed by rs17483466 at locus 2q13 (OR= 1.49; 95% CI: 0.99, 2.24; p-trend = 0.074). As expected given our previously reported findings with CLL risk, the association between rs11083846 on chromosome 19q13 and MBL risk was not significant (p-trend = 0.70). Of the four recently reported CLL-susceptibility loci SNPs located on 2q37.3, 8q24.21, 15q21.3, and 16q24.1, we found all to be associated with CLL risk but one. Specifically, the strongest association was seen for locus 8q24.21 (best tagged SNP rs1021955; OR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.70; p-trend = 0.005), followed by locus 16q24.1 (best tagged SNP rs305065 ; OR= 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.97; p-trend = 0.024). However, we found no associations for locus 15q21.3 for the previously reported SNP nor for any SNPs in LD with the previously reported SNP. Conclusions: Our MBL results provide additional robust genetic evidence that MBL is a precursor to CLL and that it shares similar underlying genetic predisposition. Also our results confirm three of the four recently reported CLL-susceptibility loci and further support the role of a genetic basis in the etiology of CLL. More research is needed to elucidate the potential manner in which these genetic loci function in CLL or MBL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
