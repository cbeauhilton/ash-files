    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3901 Poster Board III-837 Myeloproliferative neoplasias (MPNs) are a group of conditions characterized by chronic increases in some or all of the blood cells (platelets, white blood cells, and red blood cells). JAK2V617F, a gain-of-function mutation of tyrosine kinase JAK2, is found in over 90% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and about 50% of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Attempt to identify other signaling components involving the JAK2 signaling pathways has led to discovery of acquired mutations of Mpl, the receptor of thrombopoietin, in 5-10% patients with PMF and ET. To prove the pathogenesis of Mpl mutants, we have generated transgenic mice expressing the most frequently occurred Mpl mutant designated MplW515L by using the vav gene promoter which drives expression of transgenes in the hematopoietic system. We obtained three lines of MplW515L transgenic mice which all displayed similar hematological abnormalities. As expected, the mice developed ET- and PMF-like phenotypes with much elevated platelet counts, severe splenomegaly/hepatomegaly, and bone marrow/spleen myelofibrosis. Interestingly, these mice also had markedly increased white blood cells in the peripheral blood, majority of which are IgD-positive mature B-cells. Histochemical staining and flow cytometric analyses revealed infiltrations of megkaryocytes and B cells into the spleen, the presence of megkaryocytes and erythroid blast cells in the liver, and infiltrations of the bone marrow with B-cells. Reticulin staining revealed that MplW515L transgenic mice developed profound myelofibrosis in the bone marrow and spleen. In vitro hematopoietic colony assays demonstrated increased numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells including BFU-E, CFU-GM, CFU-Mk, and CFU-Pre-B in the bone marrow, mobilization of these stem/progenitor cells to peripheral blood and spleen, and their autonomous growth in the absence of growth factors and cytokines. Finally, transplantation of bone marrow cells from MplW515L mice into irradiated normal mice installed the aforementioned phenotypes into the recipient mice, indicating that expression of MplW515L altered the activity of hematopoietic stem cells. Together, our data demonstrated that transgenic expression of MplW515L not only causes PMF- and ET-like phenotypes but also lymphoproliferative disorders. Considering that Mpl is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and that oncogenic gene mutations are often associated with alteration of gene expression, we believe that MplW515L may be involved in a wider spectrum of human hematological diseases than MPNs.
