    "abstract_text": "Promising results of cord blood transplants from unrelated donors have been reported in adults. To compare of outcomes of bone marrow transplants (BMT, n = 51), and umbilical cord blood transplants (UCBT, n = 110) from unrelated donors in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) / myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we analyzed retrospectively the results of 161 adult patients with AML and MDS in our hospital. We reviewed medical records of 161 patients with AML/MDS who had received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor between August 2000 and April 2007 at Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. Patient\u2019s median age was 55 years (17\u201371). Diagnoses include de novo AML (n =85), MDS overt AML (n=48), refractory anemia (RA) (n=13), and refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) (n=15). Disease status consisted of standard (CR1 of AML and RA, n=30) and advanced (other status, n=131). Recipients of UCBT had more advanced disease than recipients of BMT at the time of transplantation (89 percent vs. 65 percent, P<0.001). The median number of nucleated cells that were infused was 0.26\u00d710 8 per kilogram of the recipient\u2019s body weight for cord blood and 2.5\u00d710 8 per kilogram for bone marrow (P<0.001). The major difference were higher number in the UCBT group of HLA mismatches (defined by serology for class 1 and molecular typing for DRB1).The donor was HLA mismatched in 96% of UCBT recipients, and in 41% of BMT recipients (P<0.001). Other significant differences were observed in preparative regimens, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Nonadjusted estimates of 2-year OS and DFS rates were 53% and 48% in the BMT group, and 33% and 25% in the UCBT group (P<0.001). However, 2-year OS and DFS rates in the standard group were not significantly different in the two groups (63% and 63% in the BMT group, and 75% and 58% in the UCBT group; p=0.98 and 0.32). Compared with BMT recipients, UCBT recipients had delayed hematopoietic recovery (Hazard ratio [HR]= 0.52; 95% confidence interval [95CI]: 0.36\u20130.75; p<0.001), increased 100 day TRM (HR=3.07; 95CI 1.45\u20136.51; p<0.01) and decreased grade II\u2013IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (HR=0.58; 95CI 0.35\u20130.96; p=0.03). Two-year relapse rate was not significantly different in the two groups. We conclude that UCBT from an unrelated donor is a therapeutic option for adult AML/MDS patients who lack an HLA-identical donors. Higher mortality, especially from non-relapse causes, is the biggest problem to be solved to increase the feasibility of this approach."
