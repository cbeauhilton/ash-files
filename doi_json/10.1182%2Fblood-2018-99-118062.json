    "abstract_text": "Background: The heterogeneous and poor survival group of Philadelphia negative (Ph-) B-ALL patients (pts) that doesn't have the most recurrent adult rearrangements ( BCR-ABL1 t(9;22) ; TCF3-PBX1 t(1;19); MLL-AF4 t(4;11)) are collectively referred to as \"triple negative\" (Ph-/-/-) ALL. CRLF2 is frequently altered in adult B-ALL, especially in Ph-like pts (50-75% of cases). Alterations that lead, in the majority of cases, to a CRLF2 overexpression. Adult pts with CRLF2 upregulated have poor outcome and novel strategies are needed to improve it. Aims: Clustering and biological characterization of Ph-/-/- ALL (that represents 61% of adult B-ALL; Roberts KG, J Clin Oncol. 2016), considering CRLF2 overexpression event, in order to define and assess biomarkers in this subgroup to test new drugs. Patients and Methods: Gene Expression Profiling (GEP; HTA 2.0 Affymetrix) were performed on 55 Ph-/-/- ALL, 29 B-ALL Ph+ at different time point of the disease and on 7 mononuclear cell of healthy donors. Data were normalized with the Expression Console Software. Successively we cluster triple negative GEP data with our validated pipeline, based on CRLF2 upregulation and in the top ten-gene list. Ph-/-/- ALL samples were then characterized for the presence of gene fusions, Copy Number Alterations (CNAs) and mutations using different approaches (TruSight Pancancer-Illumina; MLPA and/or dMLPA-MRC-Holland; SNP Array-Affymetrix; 454 Junior-Roche and PCR). Results: Clustering our Ph-/-/- gene expression data using the impact of the 10 single genes in our cohort, we could identify a defined 2-clusters-subdivision (Gr1 and Gr2; Fig 1A). The Gr2 is characterized by CTGF, CRLF2 and CD200 (Gr2=3C-up; Fig 1B) overexpression and it represents 14.1% of all B-ALL. The Gr2 GEP is similar to Ph+ one. Fusion copy number alteration and mutational screening done, detected that 3C-Up group has a higher frequency of Ph-like associated lesions (primarily CRLF2, JAK2, IL7R mutations or deletion), that mainly affect JAK-STAT pathway. Also IKZF1 and EBF1 deletions are significantly associated to Gr2 (p=0.003; p=0.016). RAS pathway genes are highly affected in Gr1. Molecular characterization shed light on a very heterogeneous scenario especially in the group 1, suggesting the need of a more discerning clustering for this group. In spite of the small number of cases is required, preliminary Gr1 subclustering discerns MLLr and ZNF384 gene expression subgroups. Notably p53 pathway is enriched in both groups but with different deregulated genes: CHEK2 is upregulated in the group1 and CDK6 in the Gr2. CRLF2 and CD200 immunoblotting and CD200 immunohistochemistry preliminary analyses suggest that protein expression of CRFL2 and CD200 are higher in Gr2 in comparison to Gr1. Conclusions: we identified a new signature, related to CRLF2 high expression, to classify Ph-/-/- ALL B-based on 10 genes. 3C-up represents 14.1% of all B-ALL and it is characterized by a) high co-expression of three main genes: CRLF2, CTGF and CD200; b) IKZF1 deletion; c) JAK-STAT pathway mutations/fusions/deletions . Gr1 represents 46.9% of all B-ALL. Gr2 GEP similarity to Ph+ one, suggests that this Gr2 could contain Ph-like pts. This new Ph-/-/- subclassification identify new potential therapeutic targets with available drug (\u03b1-CTGF, \u03b1-CD200, CDK2, CHK2 and CDK6 inhibitors; tyrosine kinase inhibitors already effective on Ph+ and Ph-like) to test.
