    "abstract_text": "Introduction: KRT-232 is a potent and selective, targeted small molecule inhibitor of human mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) homolog interactions with tumor protein 53 (p53). MDM2 prevents p53 activation and reduces p53-mediated transcription and cell cycle control. KRT-232 is under development by Kartos Therapeutics for treatment of myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Merkel cell carcinoma ( see NCT03662126, NCT03669965, NCT03787602). The KRT-232 no effect-level for in vitro inhibition of hERG function (10 \u03bcM) was approximately 147- and 73-fold greater than KRT-232 unbound C max concentrations for steady state doses of 240 mg and 480 mg, respectively, based on population pharmacokinetic (PK)-derived parameters for subjects with AML (Ma et al. submitted , ASH 2019). The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate the relationship between KRT-232 plasma concentration and changes in heart rate-corrected QT interval duration (QTc) in oncology patients treated in Amgen studies 20120106 (Gluck et al. Invest New Drugs; in press, NCT01723020) and 20120234 (Erba et al. Blood Adv 2019; NCT02016729). Methods Study 20120106 was a 2-part Phase 1 dose-exploration and dose-expansion monotherapy study in advanced solid tumors or multiple myeloma. KRT-232 doses of 15 mg (n=3), 30 mg (n=3), 60 mg (n=4), 120 mg (n=7), 240 mg (n=76), 300 mg (n=4), 360 mg (n=4) and 480 mg (n=6) were administered daily (QD) for 7 days in 21-day cycles. Subjects received up to 31 cycles of treatment. Study 20120234 was a Phase 1b study evaluating KRT-232 alone and in combination with trametinib in relapsed/refractory AML. Subjects received the following KRT-232 doses: 60 mg (n=14; n=10 co-administered with 2 mg trametinib daily [excluded from C-QTc analysis]); n=4 as single agent), 90 mg (n=4), 180 mg (n=5), 240 mg (n=3), and 360 mg (n=10). Doses were administered QD for 7 days in 14-day cycles. Subjects received up to 46 cycles of treatment. In both studies, time-matched PK and ECG measurements were collected intensively during Cycle 1 and less frequently at other visits. Triplicate 12-lead ECG data (N=3) were read by a central laboratory. A linear mixed effects model using R (v 3.5.2) was used to analyze the relationship between KRT-232 plasma concentrations and the QT interval corrected using Fridericia's method (QTcF). Effects of baseline QTcF, study, sex and tumor type on C-QTc were investigated. The upper bound of 2-sided 90% CIs for the mean QTcF change from baseline (\u0394QTcF) predicted at C max was compared to the 10 ms threshold of regulatory concern (FDA Guidance: E14(R3) 2017; Garnett et al. Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn 2018). Results ECG and PK data for this analysis were available from 130 subjects. The final model was a linear mixed-effect model with parameters for intercept, KRT-232 concentration-\u0394QTcF slope, and baseline QTcF effect on the intercept. Diagnostic plots indicated an adequate model fit. The final C-QTc model was used to predict mean \u0394QTcF and associated 2-sided 90% CI mean steady-state KRT-232 C max at doses up to the maximum clinical dose of 480 mg QD, in subjects with AML or solid tumors. The mean and upper bound of the 90% CI of \u0394QTcF were predicted not to exceed 10 ms at doses of up to 480 mg QD in subjects with AML, multiple myeloma or solid tumors. Mean (90% CI) predicted \u0394QTcF values at 480 mg QD were 2.040 (0.486, 3.595) ms for subjects with solid tumors and 4.521 (2.348, 6.693) ms for subjects with AML (Figure A). The KRT-232 concentrations at which the upper bounds of 90% CI of mean \u0394QTcF are predicted to reach 10 ms and 20 ms are 4298 ng/mL and 7821 ng/mL, respectively. These concentrations are 2.2- and 4-fold higher, respectively, than the predicted mean steady-state Cmax for 480-mg KRT-232 in subjects with solid tumors, and 1.4- and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, than the corresponding mean steady-state Cmax in subjects with AML. Conclusion Since the mean and upper bound of the 90% CI of mean \u0394QTcF were predicted not to exceed 10 ms at KRT-232 doses of up to 480 mg QD in solid tumor or AML patients, KRT-232 should not result in clinically meaningful QT prolongation at the doses currently under investigation in Kartos clinical trials.
