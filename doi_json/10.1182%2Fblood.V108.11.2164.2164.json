    "abstract_text": "Dasatinib (SPRYCEL \u00ae , BMS-354825) is a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL with significant activity in CML after imatinib failure. Dasatinib is well tolerated. The most frequent non-hematologic toxicities are gastrointestinal, rash, and fluid retention syndromes. We evaluated the incidence and outcome of pleural effusion among 131 pts with CML treated in phase I (n=50) and II (n=81) studies of dasatinib after imatinib failure or intolerance at our institution. The median age was 59 years (range, 19 to 81). Sixty-one (47%) pts were in chronic (CP), 30 (23%) in accelerated (AP), and 40 (30%) in blast phase (BP). The daily dose of dasatinib was 140 mg in 9 (7%; 6 bid, 3 qd). Dasatinib was administered for a median of 42 wks (range, 4 to 120 wks). Pleural effusion occurred in 41 (31%) pts; it was grade 3\u20134 in 17 (13%). The median time to its development was 5 wks (range, 1 to 107). Effusion occurred in 34% of pts in CP, 34% in AP, and 32% in BP. Effusions were categorized according to the volume of lung involvement: grade 1 ( 76%) in 1 (2.5%; 0.7% of total) pt. Grade \u2265 3 effusion occurred in 6 pts with CP and in 11 with advanced phase CML (5 AP, 6 BP). Effusion was more frequent among pts receiving daily doses \u2265 140 mg compared to those treated at < 140 mg (34 of 41 [83%] vs 7 of 41 [17%]; p<0.0001). Effusions were bilateral in 78% and exudative in 78% of pts. Dasatinib was interrupted in 33 (80%) and dose-reduced in 29 (71%) pts. Effusion recurred in 10 (24%) of 41 pts, leading to more than one treatment interruption. Effusion was managed with diuretics in 71%, steroids in 27% (steroids plus diuretics in 12%), thoracentesis in 22% of pts and chest tube in 5%. Dasatinib was permanently discontinued due to recurrent effusion in only 3 pts. In conclusion, pleural effusion is a not uncommon, but manageable complication of dasatinib therapy, particularly among pts in advanced phases of CML receiving dasatinib doses \u2265140 mg. In most cases, early identification, temporary dasatinib interruption, the use of diuretics and/or pulse steroids, and subsequent dasatinib dose reduction led to rapid resolution."
