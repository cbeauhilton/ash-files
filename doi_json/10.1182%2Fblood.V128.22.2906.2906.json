    "abstract_text": "For children, adolescents and young adults with T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, event free survival (EFS) following relapse is <10%. We recently showed that MLL-AF6 , del3'MLL and other re-arrangements of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL-R; KMT2A) molecular repertoire are associated with induction failure (IF) and an inferior EFS (Matlawska-Wasowska et al., Leukemia, 2016). However, we found that AF10 (MLLT10) gene structural alterations ( AF10 -R) did not confer a worse prognosis. While deregulation of HOXA9/10 is a hallmark of all MLL-R and AF10 lesions, its over-expression does not predict outcome or guide therapeutic decisions. Because there are currently no molecular features that inform treatment strategies in T-ALL, we hypothesized that supervised profiling of well-characterized cases might identify biologically relevant genes and signaling pathways for targeted T-ALL therapy. Using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarray we performed a retrospective study of 100 T-ALL patients enrolled onto COG ALL0434. We performed a 3-way analysis of MLL -R Cases (n = 12), AF10 -R Cases (n = 9), and Other T-ALL Cases (n = 79), and identified 330 probe sets that could discriminate between these groups. For the MLL -R Cases and AF10 -R Cases, 258 and 40 probe sets, respectively, were uniquely different compared to Other T-ALL Cases. Within the MLL -R Cases group, the most deregulated genes included HOXA genes, MYO6, which encodesATP-dependent motor protein, SKAP2 , a substrate of Src family kinases, transcriptional/translational regulators RUNX2, TCF4, SMAD1, CPEB2 (> 3-fold, P < 0.05) and interestingly WHAMMP2/WHAMMP3, and GOLGA8I pseudogenes (> 3-fold, P < 0.05). For the AF10 -R cases, we found that MEIS1 , HOXA3, 5, 7, 9/10, SPAG6, BMI1, and COMMD3 expression were deregulated, similar to the findings of others. We next identified genes that could discriminate between MLL -R and AF10 -R cases. Among the most overexpressed genes, we identified MYO6, RUNX2, CPEB2, ZNF827 and TCF4 (> 3-fold, FDR < 0.05) indicating that MLL -R encompass a specific biological subset, which collectively drive a unique oncogenic transcriptional program. The most downregulated gene in both MLL- and AF10-R cases was QKI , which encodes RNA-binding protein involved in alternative splicing (> 3-fold, P < 0.05). Since MLL-AF6 confers an inferior outcome, we sought to determine which genes discriminate between MLL-AF6 (n = 5) and MLL-ENL (n = 5). Among the 26 discriminatory probes sets, we found two, MLLT4 and uncharacterized RP11-38P22 that were over-expressed and 24 were underexpressed, including SMAD1, CHI3L2, MYOM2 between AF6 and ENL , respectively (> 10 fold change, FDR < 0.05). As an extension of the study we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analyses to assess functional networks. Genes that were differentially expressed in MLL -R cases were enriched in regulators of secretion and endocytosis (NES = 1.84, FDR = 0.06), actin binding and cytoskeleton function (NES = 1.7, FDR \u2264 0.25), embryonic development (NES = 1.98, FDR \u2264 0.25), and genes upregulated by hedgehog signaling pathways (NES = 1.73, FDR \u2264 0.25). Genes that were differentially expressed in AF10 -R include those that activate cytokine production (NES = 1.90, FDR \u2264 0.25). Taken together, these pathways are commonly targeted by inhibitors of kinase signaling pathways and the proteosome. In summary, we have identified an extended repertoire of aberrant gene expression in MLL -R and AF10 -R T-ALL. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for additional pre-clinical testing of in classes of therapeutic agents that may hold promise for high-risk T-ALL.
