METHODS: The proportion of CD8+HLA-DR+T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry in peripheral blood of 38 SAA (26 untreated and 12 recovered) patients and 23 normal controls. Also the expression of perforin, granzyme B, TNF-\u03b2 and FasL in CD8+HLA-DR+T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry and RT-PCR. Moreover, the apoptosis of CD3- bone marrow cells from normal persons after coculture with CD8+HLA-DR+T cells from untreated SAA patients was detected by staining with AnnexinV. The level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the supernatant were determined by automatic biochemistry analyzer. RESULTS: The ratios of CD8+HLA-DR+T cells to CD8+T cells and to CD3+T cells were 39.3 \u00b1 8.1% and 27.8\u00b17.1% in SAA patients, and were significantly higher than the corresponding ratios in controls (18.3 \u00b1 6.7% and 8.5 \u00b1 2.3%) (P < 0.05). The expression values for perforin, granzyme B, TNF-\u03b2 and FasL in CD8+HLA-DR+T cells in the untreated SAA group were 8.5%, 96.1%, 94.3% and 72.1%, respectively, which were higher than the corresponding values in the control group (1.8%, 82.0%, 32.9%, 15.6%). The mRNA expression values for perforin, granzyme B, TNF-\u03b2 and FasL in CD8+HLA-DR+T cells in the untreated SAA group were 0.66\u00b10.25, 0.56\u00b10.26, 0.61\u00b10.16, 0.77\u00b10.24, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in the control group (0.53\u00b10.14, 0.40\u00b10.13, 0.46\u00b10.15, 0.58\u00b10.16). (P < 0.05). The apoptosis values in SAA group 1 (CD8+HLA-DR+ T cells from untreated SAA patients and CD3- bone marrow mononuclear cells from remission patients), SAA group 2 (CD8+HLA-DR+ T cells from untreated SAA patients and CD3- bone marrow mononuclear cells from normal controls), the remission group (CD8+HLA-DR+ T cells and CD3- bone marrow mononuclear cells from remission patients) and the normal control (CD8+HLA-DR+ T cells and CD3- bone marrow mononuclear cells from normal controls) were 41.12 \u00b1 24.84%, 45.81 \u00b1 20.47%, 35.03 \u00b1 22.09%, 20.95 \u00b1 13.82%. There were no significant differences between SAA group 1, SAA group 2, and the remission group ( P > 0.05). However, the apoptosis in each of these groups was higher than in the normal control ( P < 0.05). The LDH levels in SAA group 1, SAA group 2, the remission group and normal control were 74.56 \u00b1 49.13 U/L, 62.61 \u00b1 31.76 U/L, 61.06 \u00b1 28.41 U/L, and 28.60 \u00b1 8.91 U/L. There were no significant differences between SAA group 1, SAA group 2, and the remission group ( P > 0.05). However, the level of LDH in these groups was significantly higher than in the normal control ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CD8+HLA-DR+T cells might contribute to bone marrow failure in SAA. Immunosuppressive therapy dramatically reduced the quantity and function of CD8+HLA-DR+T cells, and inhibitors of CD8+HLA-DR+T cells or other factors involved in this pathway will be attractive therapeutic targets in SAA.
