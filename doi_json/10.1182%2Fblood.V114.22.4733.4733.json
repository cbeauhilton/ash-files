    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4733 Autologous stem cell transplant for myeloma improves survival, but the immunologic mechanisms accounting for this improvement are unknown. Our data indicate that NKG2D+CD8+T cells may be one reason for this benefit. NKG2D, one of four NK cell activating receptors, has been identified on some CD8+T cells that mediate TCR-independent and non-MHC restricted tumor cell killing. We identified methods for ex vivo expansion of cyclophosphamide \u2013 mobilized blood progenitor cells (BPCs) from myeloma patients, as part of a clinical trial ( Cytotherapy 2008 ). Mobilized BPC are cultured in serum-free media with IL-2 (50 IU/ml) and OKT3 (50ng/ml). After 7 days, the CD8+ T cells are isolated, evaluated and tested. Myeloma cells from patients' marrow aspirates are used as targets in cytotoxicity assays. Phenotypic analysis of the expanded cells and the patients' primary myeloma cells was performed using flow cytometry. Ex vivo expansion of cyclophosphamide-mobilized BPCs induces CD8+ T cells that acquire the NKG2D receptor during ex vivo expansion ( P < 0.03 ). Three of the 6 known NKG2D ligands are strongly expressed on patients' myeloma cells, including MICA, ULBP1 and ULBP3. Using cytotoxicity assays, autologous effector cells recognize and kill the patient's autologous tumor cells (E:T 50:1, P < 0.001 ). When using K562 leukemia cells as targets (lack MHC class I), the NKG2D+CD8+ T cells kill K562, supporting an MHC class I-independent mechanism of tumor cell killing. Blocking the NKG2D receptor on CD8+ T cells prevents killing of autologous myeloma cells ( P < 0.009 ). NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity correlates with the amount of ligand expression on the target. The NKG2D receptor on CD8+T cells recognizes ligands expressed on autologous myeloma cells. The NKG2D+CD8+T cells aggressively kill myeloma cells in a non\u2013MHC restricted and TCR-independent manner. Blocking NKG2D on CD8+ T cells prevents killing of autologous myeloma cells. Since tumor cells often down regulate MHC Class I expression, the ability of NKG2D+CD8+ T cells to recognize and kill autologous myeloma cells in a non-MHC restricted manner may contribute to the beneficial effects in the treatment of myeloma. Ongoing experiments are testing these methods in mouse models and defining the molecular mechanisms involved.
