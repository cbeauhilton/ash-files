    "abstract_text": "Background: The precise mechanism of rituximab (R) plus CHOP (R-CHOP) therapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is not fully elucidated. Besides overcoming bcl-2 mediated chemoresistance, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is activated by effector cells via IgG fragment C receptors (FcR), was also proposed as a mechanism of Rituximab. The current study evaluated the impact of FcR polymorphism on the response to R-CHOP therapy for DLBCL with the basis that FcR polymorphism can affect R\u2019s affinity for ADCC effector cells. Patients and Methods: The Fc \u03b3 RIIIa and Fc \u03b3 RIIa gene polymorphisms were determined in DLBCL patients receiving R-CHOP (n=113) comparing to CHOP therapy (n=85). Results: The Fc \u03b3 RIIIa valine (V) allele was significantly correlated with higher complete response rate to R-CHOP compared to phenylalalnine (F) allele (88% in V/V versus 79% in V/F versus 50% in F/F, p=0.002), while no difference was found between Fc \u03b3 RIIa polymorphism. In addition, V/V allele was associated with faster achievement of response than other alleles. The impact of Fc \u03b3 RIIIa gene polymorphism on response rate was not noted in CHOP group. In terms of overall or event-free survival, no difference was found according to Fc \u03b3 RIIIa or Fc \u03b3 RIIa alleles. Conclusion: The Fc \u03b3 RIIIa SNP is predictive of response to R-CHOP, but does not correlate with survival in DLBCL patients.",
