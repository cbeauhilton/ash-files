    "abstract_text": "Using a murine model of ITP, we have previously demonstrated that both IVIg and a monoclonal antibody which reacts with red cells (TER-119), ameliorates thrombocytopenia. We have also recently demonstrated that passive transfer of IVIg-primed splenic leukocytes can completely recapitulate the effects of standard IVIg therapy in the amelioration of murine ITP, and further showed that CD11c+ dendritic cells were the primary cell mediating IVIg functions ( Nat Med  2006 ; 12 : 688 \u2013692 ). However, the duration of action of IVIg, TER-119 and IVIg-primed leukocytes in the inhibition of murine ITP has not been evaluated. Herein, we have evaluated the efficacy and duration of action of IVIg-primed leukocytes compared with standard therapeutic delivery of IVIg and TER-119. On day 1, mice were pre-treated with 50 ug TER-119 or 50 mg IVIg, or with only 10 6 leukocytes that had been primed for 30 minutes with IVIg, followed by extensive washing to remove all extraneous IVIg. Alternatively, leukocytes were also primed as above with BSA as a negative control. On days 2, 5, 8 and 11, mice from each group were injected with an antibody directed to integrin \u03b1II \u03b2 to induce immune thrombocytopenia and bled the following day for platelet enumeration. On days 3 and 6, platelet counts revealed that mice receiving IVIg-primed leukocytes, IVIg or TER-119 were all protected from thrombocytopenia to the same extent. Mice that were pre-treated with leukocytes primed with BSA were not protected, as expected. However, at day 9, mice that received IVIg-primed leukocytes were still completely protected from thrombocytopenia, while mice receiving IVIg or TER-119 were not protected. By day 12, none of the treatment regimens conferred protection from thrombocytopenia. We are currently repeating these experiments with IVIg-primed bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and these results will also be presented. These data confirm that in the treatment of murine immune thrombocytopenia, pre-treatment of mice with IVIg-primed leukocytes offers up to 50% longer duration of protection from thrombocytopenia than standard therapies with IVIg or TER-119.",
