    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3465 Poster Board III-353 EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 Polycomb complex and mediates transcriptional repression through its histone methyltransferase activity. It is over-expressed in many types of aggressive tumors, e.g., prostate and breast cancer and this over-expression is generally associated with poor patient prognosis. It is also over-expressed in certain lymphomas, e.g., follicular lymphoma; however its exact role and importance in normal and malignant B-cells remains unclear. Most B-cell lymphomas arise from germinal center (GC) B-cells. We thus first set out to investigate the function and activity of EZH2 in normal B-cells. We confirmed a previously published observation that expression of EZH2 protein is greatly elevated during developmental transition from resting Naive B-cells to rapidly proliferating GC B-lymphocytes. Using ChIP-on-chip, we then determined the genome-wide pattern of EZH2 binding in GC B cells and found that EZH2 targets \u223c1,800 promoters in these cells (at FDR30% of GC B cells targets are also bound in hESCs, p1,000 genes. Seeking to extrapolate our binding data to GC-derived Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), we found that the expression profile of many EZH2 target genes is anti-correlated with EZH2 mRNA levels in expression profiles of primary DLBCL tumors. Surprisingly, we found that this anti-correlation was most pronounced among GC B cell-specific EZH2 targets (p<1e-26). In turn, the EZH2 mRNA level was itself positively correlated with cellular proliferation in primary DLBCL tumors, as measured by Ki67 staining (Pearson correlation = 0.3, p<0.001). Finally siRNA-mediated down-regulation of EZH2 in SUDHL4 DLBCL cells resulted in acute cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition in SUDHL4 cells and upregulation of EZH2 target genes with cell cycle inhibitory functions such as those mentioned above. Altogether, these data suggest a scenario whereby EZH2 upregulation in GC B-cells leads to its recruitment to genes containing Polycomb Response Elements with consequent H3K27 trimethylation and silencing of a GC B cell context specific cohort of genes including those involved in restraining cellular proliferation, thus contributing to the ability of these cells to undergo massive clonal expansion. This function of EZH2 may also contribute to the malignant transformation of GC B-cells into DLBCLs and facilitate their proliferative phenotype. Thus, our results indicate that therapeutic targeting of EZH2 might have significant anti-lymphoma effects and support the rationale for development of inhibitors of the EZH2 SET domain.
