    "abstract_text": "The etiology of the aging process in human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and how this relates to diseases associated with aging, such as leukemia myelodysplasia, anemia, bone marrow failure, and altered immune function, remains unclear. We hypothesize that DNA mismatch repair (MMR) defects, specifically in HPCs, might contribute to genomic instability and in turn hematopoietic diseases of the elderly. An increase in microsatellite instability (MSI), a characteristic of MMR defects, has been shown in the peripheral blood (Neri, et al . J. Gerontol., 2005) as well as in T-cells of healthy individuals (Kirchevsky, et al . Exp. Gerontol., 2004) as a function of age but has not been examined in clonal hematopoiesis of normal individuals. Mice who receive bone marrow transplants from MMR deficient mice show increased incidence of MSI, as well as mortality due to bone marrow stem cell failure (Reese, et al. Blood, 2003). Loss of MMR pathway components have also been reported in non-polyposis colorectal cancer, myelomas, and T-cell leukemia. To study MMR deficiency in HPCs during the normal aging process, we have tested DNA of 24 CFU grown in human methylcellulose from the mononuclear fraction of three human umbilical cord blood samples (at birth), 3 human bone marrow aspirates ages 18\u201349 yr (middle age), and 3 human bone core samples ages 50\u201385 yr (older) from total hip or knee replacement patients. Each CFU was tested for MSI at five loci (BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S346, and D17S250) and given a ranking: stable (MSS), no MSI at any of the 5 loci; low frequency MSI (MSI-L), MSI seen at only one locus; or high frequency MSI (MSI-H) MSI seen at two or more loci. All five of the MSI loci were informative in at least one sample. 5\u2032 fluorescently labeled forward primers for the MSI loci were used with unlabeled reverse primers to amplify DNA prepared from CFU. These fragments were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel and Typhoon 9200 phosphoimager. A positive MSI was scored for a CFU at a particular locus if significant differences were seen between the fragment lengths of other CFU from the same patient sample at the same locus. The average frequency of MSS CFU for the, \u201cat birth\u201d samples was: 69% \u00b1 40%; for the, \u201cmiddle age\u201d samples: 47% \u00b1 6%; for the, \u201colder\u201d samples: 54% \u00b1 17%. The average frequency of MSI-L CFU for the \u201cat birth\u201d samples was: 28% \u00b1 34%; for the, \u201cmiddle age\u201d samples: 51% \u00b1 6%; for the, \u201colder\u201d samples: 40% \u00b1 10%. Finally, the average frequency of MSI-H CFU for the \u201cat birth\u201d samples was 1% \u00b1 2%; for the \u201cmiddle age\u201d samples was 1% \u00b1 2%; for the \u201colder\u201d samples was 13% \u00b1 8%. Our preliminary results show a nearly ten fold increase in frequency of MSI-H CFU seen in the older donors over younger age donors. This suggests that there may be a dramatic decline in MMR function associated with advanced age. This is the first data showing MMR deficiency associated with age in clones derived from normal human hematopoietic progenitor cells. If confirmed MMR may be an important target for both risk assessment and intervention to prevent marrow associated disorders.",
