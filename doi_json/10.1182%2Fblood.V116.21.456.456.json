    "abstract_text": "Abstract 456 We have previously demonstrated that IL-17 producing TH17cells, a new subset of T helper cells, are significantly elevated in peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) from patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and IL-17 produced by these cells promotes MM cell growth and survival, suppresses immune responses and induces osteoclast differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Based on these observations we have investigated the effects of human anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody (mAb), AIN-457, in MM. We observed that whereas IL-17A induced proliferation of MM cells (+30.7+2.7%) compared to control; anti-IL-17A mAb AIN-457 significantly inhibited MM cell growth both in presence and absence of BM stromal cells, as measured by thymidine incorporation (\u221218.7+1.5% and \u221222.7+2.6% respectively). We have further confirmed these inhibitory effects of anti-IL-17A antibody using MM cell colony forming assay with MethoCult agar plates. While presence of IL-17A increased the colony number from 80 in control plates to 188, presence of AIN-457 reduced the colonies to 60%. We next evaluated the efficacy of AIN-457 in vivo in the murine models of human myeloma; in the subcutaneous MM xenograft model, we observed significant reduction in tumor volumes by pre-treatment with AIN457 compared to control (142+77 mm versus 355+56 mm, p=0.019) while IL-17A significantly increased MM cell growth (727+135 mm, p=0.01). More importantly in the SCIDhu model of human myeloma where MM cells grow within the human microenvironment in the mice, administration of AIN-457 weekly for 4 weeks after the first detection of tumor in mice led to a significant inhibition of tumor growth as measured by human sIL-6 receptor compared to control mice (5.9\u00b12.2 ng/ml versus 23.2\u00b16.3 ng/ml; n=7; P <0.01). These pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo observations confirm the role of IL-17A produced by TH17 cells in MM and provide the rationale for clinical evaluation of AIN 457 for both anti-myeloma effects as well as to improve bone disease in myeloma.
