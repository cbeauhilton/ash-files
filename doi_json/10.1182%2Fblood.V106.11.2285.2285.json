    "abstract_text": "Mutations in SHP-2 phosphatase that cause its hyper-activation have been identified in human leukemias, in particular, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) that is characterized by hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitor cells to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin (IL)-3. However, the molecular mechanisms by which gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of SHP-2 induce leukemia are not fully understood. Our previous studies have shown that SHP-2 plays an essential role in IL-3 signal transduction in catalytic-dependent and -independent manners and that overexpression (5-to-6 fold) of wild-type (WT) SHP-2 attenuates IL-3-mediated hematopoietic cell function through dephosphorylation of STAT5. This raised the possibility that SHP-2-associated JMML was not solely attributed to the increased catalytic activities of SHP-2 GOF mutants. The SHP-2 mutants must have gained other additional functions. To test this possibility, we investigated effects of a GOF mutation (E76K, the most frequent SHP-2 mutation seen in JMML) of SHP-2 on IL-3 signal transduction in great detail by comparing signaling activities of SHP-2 E76K to WT SHP-2. Our results showed that SHP-2 E76K mutation caused myeloproliferative disease in mice, while overexpression of WT SHP-2 decreased hematopoietic potential of the transduced cells in recipient animals. E76K mutation in the N-terminal Src homology 2 domain significantly increased binding of the mutant SHP-2 to Grb2 and Gab2, two adaptor proteins coupling downstream Erk and PI3 kinase pathways to the proximity of the IL-3 receptor. As a result, IL-3-induced Erk and PI3 kinase pathways were highly activated by SHP-2 E76K mutation. In addition, Jak2 kinase activation was also markedly enhanced and due to the E76K mutation the substrate specificity of SHP-2 toward STAT5 was changed. Dephosphorylation of STAT5 by SHP-2 E76K was alleviated. These studies suggest that in addition to elevated catalytic activity, profound changes in protein-protein interaction capacities of GOF mutant SHP-2 play an important role in the pathogenesis of SHP-2-related leukemias."
