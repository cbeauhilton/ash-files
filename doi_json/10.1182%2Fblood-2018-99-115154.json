    "abstract_text": "Genomic data has led to the identification of bio-markers of morphological features and disease sub-entities in myeloid neoplasia (MN). Somatic TET2 mutations ( TET2 MT ) are frequently found in MN, particularly in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). TET2 MT are mostly loss-of-function and hypomorphic hits leading to inactivation of TET2 protein. In fact, impaired TET2 activity skews the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells toward proliferating myeloid precursors favoring myeloid tumorigenesis. However, the contribution of TET2 MT to clinico-hematological features in MN has been controversial, possibly due to studies containing too few patients relative to the combinatorial diversity of co-occurring lesions. We recently reported on the clonal architecture of TET2 MT in patients with MN. Of these, 40% of the patients harbored biallelic TET2 MT ( biTET2 MT ). Further analysis showed a frequent occurrence of biallelic TET2 inactivation ( biTET2 i ). To date, only a few studies have investigated the clinical consequences of biTET2 i in MN. We hypothesized that the presence of biTET2 i identifies a group of patho-morphological features that independently define a distinct MN subtype. To test our hypothesis, we studied correlations between mutational configuration, clinico-hematological/morphological features and survival outcomes in cases that were biTET2 i vs. not ( biTET2 - ), combining whole exome and targeted deep sequencing, SNP-arrays and conventional cytogenetics. Among 1,001 clinically annotated MN patients, 82 were biTET2 i (66 biTET2 MT , 13 hemizygous TET2 MT and 3 homozygous TET2 MT , i.e. UPD) and 919 were biTET2 - (96 monoallelic TET2 MT and 823 wild type). TET2 hits were ancestral lesions in 72% of biTET2 i vs. 38% in biTET2 - cases ( P <.0001). When the 1 st TET2 hit was ancestral in biTET2 i , the most common subsequent hit was a 2 nd TET2 MT , followed by SRSF2 MT , ASXL1 MT , KRAS MT /NRAS MT and DNMT3A MT . Truncation mutations (frameshift or nonsense variants) were found in 83% of biTET2 i vs. 65% of biTET2 - cases ( P =.02). A second TET2 hit in biTET2 MT cases significantly increases the accrual of additional truncating changes. Furthermore, biTET2 i were significantly enriched for additional hits in SRSF2 MT (33%; P <.0001) and KRAS MT /NRAS MT (16%; P =.03) while biTET2 - for TP53 MT (11%; P =.03). SRSF2 MT was also found to be significantly associated with biTET2 i when compared to monoallelic TET2 MT ( P =.02). In contrast, b iTET2 i cases showed absence of S RSF2 MT in the absence of monocytosis. We then assessed associations of biTET2 i with specific genotype/phenotype. Clinical analyses revealed that cases with biTET2 i compared to cases with biTET2 - were older (91% \u226560 years vs. 74%, P =.0004) and more commonly had normal karyotype (65% vs . 45%; P =.0007). BiTET2 i were enriched in patients with CMML1/2 (44% vs . 9%; P <.0001), and predominantly in lower-risk cases (62% vs. 47% in biTET2 - ; P =.003). While a second TET2 hit occurred frequently, biTET2 i did not portend faster progression but rather associated with monocytic differentiation, consistent with its prevalence in CMML. In addition, among biTET2 i with SRSF2 MT or KRAS MT /NRAS MT , CMML was diagnosed in 70% ( P =.001) and 77% ( P =.01) of the cases, respectively, significantly higher than what was seen in the biTET2 i population (44%). In biTET2 - cases, leukopenia (81%; P <.0001), neutropenia (52%; P =.008), pancytopenia (27%; P =.008) and increased marrow blast percentages (\u22655% in 33%; P =.01) were more prevalent than in biTET2 i cases, which in return co-segregated with monocytosis (84%; P 70% in 67%; P <.0001) and marked myeloid dysplasia (68%; P =.0003). Given our observation of a highly significant ( P <.0001) relationship between biTET2 i , CMML diagnosis and/or monocytosis, we also evaluated patients without frank diagnosis of CMML (CMML - ) and compared biTET2 i vs. biTET2 - for associations with monocytosis and myeloid dysplasia, two hallmarks of CMML. Increased monocyte counts among CMML - cases were significantly overrepresented in biTET2 i cases (72%; P =.03) vs. biTET2 - (55%) as was myeloid dysplasia (72% vs. 46%; P =.0001). Lastly, biTET2 i as a sole hit or in combination with other hits did not influence survival outcomes. In sum, biTET2 i invariantly associates with distinct morphological and clinical phenotype. It may thus represent an early diagnostic marker of morphologic MN sub-entities. Disclosures Nazha: MEI: Consultancy.
