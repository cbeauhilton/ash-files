    "abstract_text": "Granulopoiesis constitutes a dynamical system, able to respond acutely to internal or external stimuli, with production of neutrophils. Because neutrophils are short-lived (<24 hr) in the peripheral circulation, a major component of bone marrow activity is devoted to their generation. The hematopoietic growth factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), is the most important growth factor for the production of granulocytes. When it or its cognate receptor, the G-CSF Receptor, is genetically ablated in mice, severe neutropenia results. The two most commonly expressed isoforms are the normal full-length G-CSF Receptor (class I) and a truncated, differentiation-defective receptor (class IV). We hypothesized that expression of these two receptor isoforms critically control granulopoiesis. We have developed a quantitative PCR assay and have found that class IV expression is variably upregulated in primary AML and leukemic cell lines. Receptor endocytosis rates differ between class I and class IV, which contributes to proximal phosphoprotein signaling profile (e.g. Lyn, Erk1/2, Akt). Aberrant expression of class IV leads to profound changes in intracellular signaling of both positive and negative effectors, resulting in proliferation without differentiation. Using a multi-scale approach, we have developed a mathematical model containing ordinary differential equations (ODE) to explain the kinetic properties of this dynamical system. This model involves three major steps: probability of receptor dimerization, single cell fate decision making, and population distribution of differentiated and non-differentiated cells. Computer simulation of receptor isoform expression and endocytosis revealed a decreased ratio of class I to class IV over time until steady state (\u223c120 min). Further validation is underway. This model can be applied to better understand disease states such as congenital neutropenia and acute myeloid leukemia, where aberrant G-CSF Receptor signaling can occur."
