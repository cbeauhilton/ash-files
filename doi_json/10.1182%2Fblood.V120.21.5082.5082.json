    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5082 Introduction: Retrospective analyses suggest an improved outcome for patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in whom safe watchful waiting can be employed. We explored our own cohort of patients treated at the H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in an effort to validate these data. Methods: We retrospectively identified 280 patients with MCL treated at our institution, for whom treatment data are available among 260. Patients were stratified according to whether they were treated within 3 months, within 3\u201312 months, and beyond 12 months. Treatment includes radiation, surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or any combination there-of. Median overall survival (OS) is calculated from date of diagnosis to death. Median progression free survival (PFS) is calculated from time of treatment start to progression or death. Results: Of 260 evaluable patients 191 were treated within 3 months of diagnosis, 33 were treated between 3\u201312mo, and 36 had received no treatment beyond one year. The median OS for each group were approximately 62mo, 74mo, and 130mo, respectively ( Figure 1 A). Median PFS following treatment initiation was nearly indistinguishable between the three groups, at approximately 24mo, 26mo, and 19mo, respectively ( Figure 1 B). Conclusions: Time to treatment of greater than 12 months may identify those with a more indolent course. However, once treatment is required, patients appear to experience similar treatment benefit.
