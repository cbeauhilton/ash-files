    "abstract_text": "The constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl leads to aberrant expression of multiple genes by several mechanisms, including dysregulation of transcription. Recently though, increasing attention has been focused on the effect of Bcr-Abl in dysregulating translation. Our group has previously documented the effects of Bcr-Abl on key regulators of cap-dependent translation and the role that this mechanism plays in transformation (Ly et al, Cancer Research, 2003; Prabhu et al., Oncogene, in press). Here we describe a novel form of translational control by Bcr-Abl. Specifically, we show how Bcr-Abl regulates cap-independent translation of Lymphoid Enhancer Factor-1 (LEF-1) via a bona fide internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of LEF1. Lymphoid Enhancer Factor-1 (LEF-1), a transcription factor that mediates Wnt signals via interaction with \u03b2-catenin, is often expressed in cancers derived from aberrant Wnt signaling. Lately, it has been reported that LEF1 transcripts are elevated in CML. We examined LEF-1 expression in primary CML cells and cell lines (K562 and Ba/F3-Bcr-Abl) and show that LEF-1 protein is detected in all patient-derived cells. Treatment of these cells with the Bcr-Abl imatinib mesylate (imatinib) inhibits LEF-1 expression in imatinib-sensitive cancers, but not in cancers that exhibit clinical resistance even though such cancers express imatinib-sensitive Bcr-Abl. For those cancers that are sensitive, inhibition of Bcr-Abl has a partial effect on LEF1 mRNA levels, and a significant effect on LEF-1 protein levels. LEF-1 protein is produced via two IRESs in it\u2019s 5\u2032 UTR. IRES-driven translation of LEF-1 was highly sensitive to Bcr-Abl as treatment with imatinib reduced IRES activity 5 fold. Transfection of CML cells with dicistronic mRNAs suggests that Bcr-Abl stimulates LEF-1 protein production through steps in the nucleus and cytoplasm. We propose that, in addition to its strong effects on cap-dependent translation in CML, Bcr-Abl is an important regulator of alternative translation pathways. mRNAs that are translated via IRES-dependent mechanisms are particularly relevant to cancer since they encode proteins that regulate cell proliferation and survival. Together, these observations underscore the important role which dysregulated translation plays in transformation, and suggest novel approaches with which to counteract the transforming properties of Bcr-Abl.",
