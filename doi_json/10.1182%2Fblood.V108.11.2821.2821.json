    "abstract_text": "Whether chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) represents latent or proliferating disease has been intensively debated. Whilst the dogma that CLL results from accumulation of dormant lymphocytes is supported by the unresponsiveness of leukemic cells to antigens and polyclonal activators, recent in vivo kinetic measurements show that B-lymphocytes do divide at significant rates in CLL. However, B cell kinetics were not compared between CLL patients and healthy controls so it was not possible to ascertain to what extent lymphocyte kinetics were aberrant in CLL. We compared proliferation rates of B- and T-lymphocytes in CLL patients and healthy controls, using a pulse-chase approach based on incorporation of deuterium from 6,6- 2 H 2 -glucose into DNA. We found dramatically reduced in vivo rates of CD3 \u2212 CD19 + cell proliferation in CLL compared with controls (mean 0.47 versus 1.66 %/day respectively, P=0.001), equivalent to an extended half-life of circulating B-cells (147 days versus 42 days). Labeled (dividing) CD3 \u2212 CD19 + cells had death rates similar to the healthy controls (2.29 versus 3.55 %/day, P=0.495). Despite such aberrant B-cells kinetics, T-cell proliferation was unaffected by CLL (1.77 versus 1.40 %/day, P=0.488). We conclude that, B-cell proliferation rates are reduced in leukemic patients compared to healthy subjects and that most circulating CD3 \u2212 CD19 + cells are quiescent, long-lived cells.",
