    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene resulting in a disease that affects more than 100,000 Americans and millions worldwide. Though pain is the hallmark of SCD, patients also suffer damage to most organ systems. Sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization occurs when deoxygenated, rendering red blood cells rigid and fragile. Production of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular hypoxia in RBCs further accelerates the pathology associated with SCD. Recently, vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and organ damage were established to be strongly associated with oxidative stress in RBCs. This occurs when there is an increase in oxidants that exceeds the cellular anti-oxidant defenses. Excessive ROS can trigger a cascade of oxidative reactions that damage membrane lipids, and essential enzymatic antioxidants such as GPx-1, ultimately leading to hemolysis and multi-organ dysfunction. ROS generation in RBCs of SCD patients is due to factors such as HbS auto-oxidation and potentially aberrant mitochondrial function. We recently determined that red blood cells obtained from SCD mice and SCD patients retain their mitochondria compared to control subjects. Mitochondria retained SCD RBCs are also associated with elevated levels of ROS and hemolysis. Oxidative stress in the RBCs of SCD patients may be elevated by lower levels of antioxidant proteins such as the selenium-dependent enzyme GPX1. GPX1 was first described as an enzyme capable of protecting hemoglobin from ROS and has been reported to be lower in the RBCs in SCD. Selenium levels are lower among African Americans in the Chicago area and elsewhere. In this regard, it is notable that in the United States, African Americans represent the majority of those with SCD. To investigate the relationship between selenium levels and SCD, we have utilized a mouse model of SCD to examine the impact of a reduced intake of selenium on parameters associated with SCD pathology. SCD mice on a selenium-deficient diet (<0.01 mg/kg diet) were compared to mice fed with a selenium-adequate diet (0.1mg/kg). SCD mice in the selenium-deficient group exhibited an increase in mitochondria retaining RBCs (Se deficient: 26%\u00b16.9%, n=3 vs. Se adequate: 5 % \u00b1 3.5%, n=3, p<0.01), reduced Hb levels (Se deficient 5.7\u00b1 0.17 g/dl, n=3 vs. Se adequate 7.0\u00b1 0.83 g/dl, n=4 p<0.05), and an increased RBC oxygen consumption rate (OCR). These results support the hypothesis that low selenium status likely results in reduced levels of anti-oxidant selenoproteins and enhanced SCD severity.
