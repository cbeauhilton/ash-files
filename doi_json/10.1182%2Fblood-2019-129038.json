    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Selinexor is a first-in-class Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compound that selectively binds and inactivates XPO1, therefore forcing the nuclear retention and re-activation of cell cycle regulators such as p53, FOXO, IkB, and Rb. Selinexor in combination with low dose dexamethasone (Sel-dex) was recently approved based on data from the STORM study, which induced an overall response rate (ORR) of 26.2% in patients with penta-exposed, triple-class refractory multiple myeloma (TCR-MM). Patients with TCR-MM often present with plasmacytomas along with serological markers of MM. Methods : Here we analyzed the effects of Sel-dex in patients from the STORM study who had baseline plasmacytomas. Results : 122 patients were in enrolled in the STORM study including 27 with a baseline plasmacytoma. The majority of plasmacytomas were soft tissue (22 patients) and 5 patients had soft tissue disease extension from a bone (rib (2), iliac (2), sacral vertebral). The median age of patients with plasmacytomas was 64 years, the median prior therapies were 7 (range 4 - 15), and 8/27 patients with a plasmacytoma had high risk cytogenetics. Of the 27 patients, 11 patients did not have a follow up plasmacytoma assessment: 6 were not evaluable for response as they came off therapy due to clinical progression and/or adverse events, 4 had stable disease (SD) with no evidence of plasmacytoma change, and 1 had progressive disease (PD) on serum M-protein with no evidence of plasmacytoma change. Sixteen of the 27 patients did have follow-up plasmacytoma assessments (methods of measurements included PET, CT, MRI or Clinical). The median days from baseline plasmacytoma evaluation to follow up was 41 days (range 22 - 119). Five patients had objective responses, based upon para-protein and plasmacytoma reductions according to IMWG criteria (1 very good partial response [VGPR], 4 partial responses [PR]) for an ORR of 18.5%. In addition, 2 patients had a minimal response (MR), 4 had SD and 5 had objective PD. Among the 5 patients with \u2265PR, 3 plasmacytomas completely resolved, 1 showed near complete resolution, and another showed size reduction with no metabolic activity on PET. Of the 2 patients with a MR, 1 plasmacytoma completely resolved and 1 showed reduced PET uptake. Among the 4 patients with SD, 1 plasmacytomas completely resolved, 1 increased in size and 2 had unknown outcomes as they were assessed clinically. Among the 5 patients with PD, 1 plasmacytomas decreased in size, 1 increased in size, and 3 had unknown outcomes as they were assessed clinically. Conclusions : Of the 16 patients with TCR-MM and a follow up plasmacytoma assessment enrolled on STORM, 9/16 of the plasmacytomas either completely resolved or decreased in size and/or metabolic activity. Effects on plasmacytomas occurred in patients with objective responses (\u2265PR), as well as in patients with MR, SD and PD. These observations support the finding that Sel-dex is active in patients with plasmacytomas and heavily pretreated TCR-MM.
