    "abstract_text": "Introduction Large cell lymphoma transformed from an indolent lymphoproliferative disorder typically carries a worse prognosis than de novo diffuse large B cell lymphoma. When transformation to large cell lymphoma occurs in CLL (Richter's syndrome), traditional anthracycline or platinum based therapy is associated with a median survival of <12 months. Better, more targeted therapies are needed. We describe 4 patients with transformation to large cell lymphoma who responded to ibrutinib. Cases: Patient A, age 68 at transformation, was a 64 year old male at diagnosis with CLL Rai stage 1. He was initially asymptomatic with a performance status of 0. 4 years later he developed dyspnea on exertion after one block and was found to have a left pleural effusion with diffuse lymphadenopathy with increased PET avidity. Biopsy of a supraclavicular node was positive for extracavitary primary effusion lymphoma, HHV8+, CD5-, CD10-. Patient was given R-CHOP x 6 cycles; he relapsed after 18 months and was given ibrutinib 560mg daily with monthly rituximab x 6 and achieved a PR with reversion to CLL. He is currently continuing ibrutinib in this remission for 10+ months. Patient B, age 90 at transformation, was a 68 year old female at diagnosis of CLL, Rai stage 0. She developed stage III CLL 18 years after diagnosis, was treated with BR x 6 cycles. 2 years later she developed Richter's transformation which was CD10+. Although she achieved a PR after 4 months of ibrutinib 560mg with monthly rituximab, her PS was 4 and she was transferred to hospice and expired 4.5 months after initiating ibrutinib/rituximab. Patient C, age 87 at relapse, was a 73 year old male at diagnosis when he originally presented with stage 1 DLBCL transformed from marginal zone lymphoma. He had 3 cycles of R-CHOP and RT to involved area and was disease free for 14 years until he had worsening thrombocytopenia. This was monitored for 3 years until age 87 when CT/PET showed increasing SUV in multiple lymph nodes and the spleen. Biopsy showed diffuse large B cell lymphoma, CD10-. He was started on ibrutinib 560mg with monthly rituximab x 6. He achieved a CR by CT/PET except for persistent splenic disease. He underwent splenectomy and continues in CR on ibrutinib at 9+ months. Patient D is an 83 year old female with large cell transformation from marginal zone lymphoma at diagnosis. She had stage IV disease with large cells involving pleural fluid and bone marrow. She was CD10-. She received R-CHOP x 3 with progressive disease. At that time ibrutinib 560mg alone was initiated. She has a CR based on recent CT/PET findings and is continuing ibrutinib at 18+ months. Conclusion: All of the above patients responded to ibrutinib given with or without rituximab with symptomatic and objective remissions; all of the CD10 negative cases are alive and still responding 9-18 months after initiating therapy. Studies examining the efficacy of ibrutinib in diffuse large B cell lymphoma are underway. This report supports the need for further study of ibrutinib in the transformed setting, particularly in the elderly where patients may not be appropriate for aggressive therapies.
