    "abstract_text": "TCR zeta chain of TCR-CD3 receptor complex is though to be critical for T cells development and T cell effector function. The absence of TCR zeta chain not only influences the TCR expression on the cell membrane, but also impairs the proliferative response and the level of activation of mature T cells. Recently, the abnormal expression of TCR zeta chain was found different disease, for example in hematological malignancy. In the present study, we analyzed the expression level of TCR zeta chain gene in T cells from patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and polycythemia vera (PV), thereby to estimate the feature of T cells activation status. Real-time PCR with SYBR Green I technique was used for detecting the expression level of TCR zeta chain gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with AA (25 cases),PV (12 cases), and 30 normal individuals. \u03b2 2 -microglobulin gene was used as an endogeneous reference. Evaluation of TCR zeta chain gene expression level were used the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method. Compared with the normal control, TCR zeta chain gene expression level could be divided into two groups: 10 patients with AA (40%) and 5 patients with PV (41.7%) were over expression, while 15 patients with AA (60%) and 7 patients with PV (58.3%) were down expression. The expression level of TCR zeta gene is nonsignificat age-associated in both AA and PV patients. Moreover, the expression level of TCR zeta gene is nonsignificant age-associated or gender-link in T cells from patients with AA. The signaling pathway of T cells activation might display some disorder in patients with AA or PV. The effect of the change of TCR zeta chain gene expression pattern in AA and PV patients should be further confirmed."
