    "abstract_text": "Resveratrol (3,5,4\u2032-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), a plant antibiotic produced in a wide variety of plants (including grapes, peanuts, and mulberries) in response to stress, injury, UV irradiation, and fungal infection, has been shown to inhibit cell growth of several types of cancer. Here, we have investigated the effects of Resveratrol on the proliferation and apoptosis in T-cell lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. These T-ALL cells were derived from T-ALL of mice with the T-cell specific deletion of the Pten tumor suppressor gene. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the T-ALL cells are positive for CD4 and negative for CD8. Morphologically, the T-ALL cells strikingly mimic human counterparts. Western blot analysis confirmed the absence of Pten expression and high expression level of phosphorylated Akt of the T-ALL cells. A single dose treatment of the T-ALL cells with Resveratrol (ranging from 3 to 50 mM) resulted in significant decrease in cell growth. In addition, Resveratrol treatment with the above concentrations showed a remarkable increase in apoptosis. The vehicle treated T-ALL cells grew exponentially and had minimal apoptotic cell death. Further investigation of the mechanisms of the Resveratrol\u2019s efforts on inhibiting T-ALL cell growth and inducing apoptosis is on-going. In addition, combination of Resveratrol with conventional chemotherapy reagents for treating T-ALL is also being evaluated."
