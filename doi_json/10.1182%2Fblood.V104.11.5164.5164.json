    "abstract_text": "In order to compare the outcomes of unrelated umbilical cord blood transplants (UCBT) or bone marrow transplants, 102 children with hematologic malignancies transplanted with unrelated umbilical cord blood (n=35, M:F=21:14, median age 4 years) or unrelated bone marrow transplants (UBMT) (n= 67, M:F=49:18, median age 9 years) were analyzed in a retrospective single center study (between Aug. 1997 and Dec. 2003 in the Catholic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center of Korea). HLA mismatches were defined by serology for class I and molecular typing for DRB1. The donor was HLA mismatched in 94% of UCBTs (33 of 35 UCBT) and in 0 % of UBMT. Non-adjusted estimates of 2-year event-free survival rates were 46 % and 57 %, respectively (P > 0.2). Engraftment failures of donor cells occurred in 17 % (6 out of 35) of UCBT and in 6 % (4 out of 67) of UBMT. Grade >= III acute GVHDs developed in 3 out of 29 (10 %) engrafted patients who underwent UCBT and in 17 out of 63 (27 %) engrafted patients who underwent UBMT. Early TRM at day 100 was 31 % (11 out of 35) for UCBT and 22 % (12 out of 67) for UBMTs. Within post-transplant month 3, CMV infections occurred in 37 % of UCBT and 54 % of UBMT, but most of them did not progress to CMV disease due to early ganciclovir treatment. Chronic GVHD developed in 2 out of 22 (9 %) patients who underwent UCBT and in 15 out of 49 (31 %) patients underwent UBMT. In conclusion, the use of UCBT as a source of hematopoietic stem cells is a reasonable option for children with hematologic malignancies lacking an acceptable, matched unrelated marrow donor.",
