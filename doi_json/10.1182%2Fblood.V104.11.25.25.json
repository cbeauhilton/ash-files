    "abstract_text": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease with recognized variability in clinical outcome, genetic features, and cells of origin. To date, transcriptional profiling has been used to highlight similarities between DLBCL tumor cells and normal B-cell subtypes and associate genes and pathways with unfavorable outcome. Given the genetic heterogeneity in DLBCL, there are likely to be subsets of tumors with different pathogenetic mechanisms and possible treatment targets. To identify DLBCL subtypes that were sufficiently robust to be captured by multiple methods, we analyzed the profiles of 176 newly diagnosed DLBCLs using three different clustering algorithms (hierarchical clustering (HC), self-organizing maps (SOM), and probabilistic clustering (PC)), the top 5% of genes with the highest reproducibility across duplicate samples and largest variation across patient tumors, and a resampling-based method (consensus clustering) that automatically selects the most stable numbers of clusters with each algorithm. Three discrete subsets of DLBCLs -- \u201cOxidative Phosphorylation\u201d (OxPhos), \u201cB-cell Receptor/Proliferation\u201d and \u201cHost Response\u201d (HR) -- were identified, characterized using gene set enrichment analysis and confirmed in an independent series of newly diagnosed DLBCLs with available array data. There was an association between cluster membership and examined genetic abnormalities in DLBCL. BCL2 translocations were more common in the OxPhos cluster whereas BCL6 translocations were more frequent in the BCR/proliferation cluster. Translocations of either type were uncommon in the HR cluster. Patients with HR DLBCLs were also significantly younger than those with OxPhos or BCR/proliferation tumors; HR patients also had a significantly higher incidence of splenic and BM involvement. The unique characteristics of HR tumors - fewer known genetic abnormalities and prominent host immune and inflammatory cell transcripts -prompted us to assess host immune cells in study tumors using morphologic and immunohistochemical approaches. HR DLBCLs contained significantly higher numbers of morphologically distinct CD2+/CD3+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and interdigitating S100+/GILT+/CD1a-/CD123- dendritic cells. The HR cluster shared features of histologically defined T-cell/histiocyte-richBCL, including fewer known genetic abnormalities, younger age at presentation and frequent splenic and bone marrow involvement. The current study identifies tumor microenvironment and host inflammatory response as defining features in DLBCL, provides insights into the nature of the host immune response in a major DLBCL subtype and suggests rational treatment targets in newly identified tumor groups.",
