    "abstract_text": "Abstract LBA-3 Introduction: IDH1 is the gene coding for the soluble isocitrate dehydrogenease 1 (NADP+), which catalyzes the oxidative decaroxylation of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate. The gene has been shown to be frequently mutated in high-grade gliomas at residue p.R132, which is located in the substrate binding site of IDH1 . So far, several other tumors have been analyzed without detection of the respective mutation (Bleeker et al., Human Mutation 2009). However, recently a next generation sequencing project found IDH1 mutated in 8.5% of AML with normal karyotype (Mardis et al., NEJM, 2009). Aim: To further evaluate the importance of IDH1R132 ( IDH1 mut) in AML we have analyzed a cohort of 999 comprehensively characterized AML cases. Methods: The respective base exchange was analysed by a LightCycler based melting curve assay with subsequent sequencing of the positive samples. Results: The cohort was comprised of 536 male and 463 female patients (median age: 65.9 years; range: 17.1- 93.3 years). 833 had de novo AML (83.4%), 122 AML following MDS (s-AML,12.1%) and 44 AML after previous treatment of different malignancies (t-AML, 4.4%). Karyotype was available in all cases: 681 had a normal karyotype (NK) AML, and 319 had chromosomal aberrations (t(15;17): n=29; inv(16): n=12, t(8;21): n=23, t(11q23): n=10, t(6;9): n=4, inv(3): n=3; -7: n=27, +8: n=29, +13: n=11, -Y: n=4; complex aberrant: n=60, others: n=106). Overall, in 93 pts IDH1 p.R132 mutations were detected (9.3%). Five different amino acid exchanges were observed: R132C (n=49), R132L (n=22), R132 H and G (n=7, each), and R132S (n=5). With respect to history of the patient IDH1mut were found in 80/833 of de novo AML (9.6%), 11/122 (9.0%) of s-AML, and 2/44 (4.5%) of t-AML, respectively (n.s.). More females (57/463, 12.3%) than males (36/536; 6.7%) had IDH1 mut (p=0.003). Age was slightly higher in the mutated cases (63.9 vs. 61.9 years, n.s.). No differences were found for WBC count. IDH1 mut were distributed differently between karyotypes: in NK 69/681 (10.1%) and in aberrant karyotypes 24/318 (7.5%). However, IDH1 was never mutated in inv(16), t(8;21), t(6;9), t(11q23), inv(3), or in complex aberrant karyotypes (n=112). In 2 of 27 cases (7.4%) with t(15;17) an IDH1 mutation was detected. Thus, the IDH1 mututations clustered in the intermediate risk karyotype group in comparison to the good or poor risk groups (91/771; 11.8% vs 2/134 (1.5%), p<0.001). The cohort was also characterized for several other molecular mutations. FLT3 -ITD was present in 22% (212/954), FLT3 -TKD in 6.7% (33/496), NPM1 in 35.4% (329/929), NRAS in 14.6% (48/328), MLL -PTD in 6.9% (64/932), CEBPA mutations in 7.4% (48/645) and RUNX1 mutations in 33.0% (99/299) of analysed cases, respectively. IHD1 mutations were found to be more frequent in NPM1 mutated than in NPM1 wt cases (41/329; 12.4% vs 48/598; 8.0%, p= 0.019) and in those with MLL -PTD (11/64; 17.2% vs 77/867; 8.9%, p= 0.031). With lower frequencies IDH1 mut were also detected together with RUNX1 mutations (n=8/99), CEBPA mutations (n=2/48), NRAS mutations (n=7/48), and FLT3 -TKD (n=1/33). IDH1 was similarly distributed between FLT3 -ITD mutated and unmutated cases (18/212; 8.5% vs. 72/744; 9.7%). In 22 (23.7%) of all IDH1 mut AML no additional mutation was detected, whereas in 48 (51.6%) one additional, in 22 (23.7%) two additional and in one case three additional mutations were found. An unfavourable effect of IDH1 mut on event free survival (EFS) was observed in the total group (median: 272 vs. 456 days; p=0.007) as well as in those with intermediate risk karyotype (median: 272 vs. 449 days; p=0.008). A shorter EFS of the IDH1 mut was particularly seen in the NPM1wt cohort (median: 244 vs. 375 days; p=0.038) with a strong trend for an independent effect in a multivariate analysis (p=0.089). Conclusions: IDH1 mutations are frequent in AML and are prognostically unfavourable especially in the NPM1 wt cohort. IDH1 mutations seem to be a new class of mutation probably complementing with the classical type 1 and type 2 mutations. Disclosures: Schnittger: MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory: Equity Ownership.
