    "abstract_text": "Background : AML remains a disease diagnosed in the aging population with chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplant in some cases being the standard of care. Although response rates remain around 50-60%, treatment related mortality and disease relapse remain high. Adoptive immunotherapy, especially those targeting T cell co-inhibitory receptors, has proven successful in solid malignancies however, AML remains less explored. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated the feasibility to generate autologous AML reactive T cells in vitro (Mehta/Szabolcs; Immunotherapy 2016). It was noted that \"resistant\" AML blasts over expressed a number of genes associated with immunosuppressive characteristics. Over expression of these genes may induce T cell functional exhaustion. Therefore, we hypothesized that blocking PD-1 and/or CTLA-4 during co-culture with IFNg activated AML blasts, may enhance T cell activation and cytotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, we tested CTL responses against AML blasts and IFNg ELISpot formation after blocking with PD-1, CTLA-4 or both receptors, and compared the response in untreated T cells. Gene expression profiles of co-stimulatory/co-inhibitory receptors were also monitored to test for correlation. Methods : We evaluated 12 patients with newly diagnosed AML under an IRB approved protocol with written informed consent of patients. Mononuclear cell preparation was generated from fresh marrow samples or drawn from a biorepository of previously cryopreserved leukophereses. T cells were then purified using immunomagnetic CD3/CD28 beads (Life technologies) and cultivated in media with IL-2 and IL-7 for 2 weeks. AML blasts were cultured over a supporting layer of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) derived from healthy BM donors for 1 week and then cryopreserved. T cells were then co-cultured with restored and irradiated autologous AML cells at an effector: target (E: T) ratio of 5:1 to 40:1. AML and T cells were co-cultured in the presence of Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4), or Nivolumab (anti-PD-1), or a combination of both drugs. T cells and AML were re stimulated in X-vivo 15 with IL-12, IL-15 and IL-2 weekly x 3weeks. T cell response to AML was quantitated by IFNg ELISpot assay and Europium TDA (EuTDA) CTL assays independently. Co-stimulatory/co-inhibitory expression on T cells was examined with RT-q PCR assay. Paired-sample student t test was used for statistical analysis with p<0.05. Results and Discussion : Out of 12 samples, 10 (83%) yielded viable AML cells available for cytotoxicity assay. One third (33%) of co-cultures exhibited a positive T cell response in CTL assays (\"killers\"). There was no difference in CTL activity by blockade of either PD-1 or CTL-4 ( Fig 1 ). IFN-\u0263 spot formation in ELISpot was observed in 4/10 samples (40%) with statistical significance noted in cells blocked with PD-1 as compared to all other blockade types ( Fig 2 ). The results indicated that in vitro priming with autologous AML blasts or together with blocking PD-1 can enhance T cell response in 33-40%. By gene expression analysis, the ratio of co-stimulatory to co-inhibitory genes was calculated. In PD-1 blocked cells, the ratio of activation/inhibition was not impacted in T cells from \"killers\" (0.9; p=0.1), however, T cells from \"non-killer cells\" had a diminished ratio due to higher expression of co-inhibitory molecules (0.4; p=0.04) ( Fig 3 ). This trend was also present in CTLA-4 blocked cells (0.85; p=0.4 in killers vs 0.54; p=0.03 in non-killers) (data not shown). Interestingly, dual blockage failed to influence gene expression ratio, data not shown. Conclusion : The above studies demonstrate that cytotoxicity can be achieved in T cells when primed against autologous AML. PD-1 blockade can enhance IFNg production and cytotoxic responses, but CTLA-4 and dual blockade failed to enhance T cell function. The upregulation of an inhibitory pattern of genes in T cells that did not express cytotoxicity (non-killers) could allude to an \"inhibitory phenotype\" that may be resistant to immunotherapy drug blockade and requires further study.
