    "abstract_text": "Background Modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced HIV associated morbidity and mortality, and allowed a similar treatment approach of aggressive lymphomas in PLWH to that of their HIV negative counterparts. Australia is an ethnically diverse country with a low HIV prevalence and an excellent population-wide ART coverage and adherence in PLWH. We aimed to describe the real-world Australian experience in managing PLWH diagnosed with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL), and compare our treatment approach and outcomes against international data. Methods This was a retrospective, multicenter study conducted by the Australasian Lymphoma Alliance across 6 centers in 5 states. HIV positive patients with biopsy proven BL and DLBCL, diagnosed between 1st January 2009 and 31st December 2019 were identified through each institution's database. Baseline patient and disease characteristics, treatment exposure and outcomes were extracted from hospital medical records. Descriptive statistics, and survival analyses were performed as appropriate. Results 44 patients (24 DLBCL, 20 BL) were included in the analysis. The median age was 52 years (range 32-78). The median follow-up was 1.8 years (range 0.1-13.1). 36 (82%) patients presented with advanced stage (III-IV) disease. 28 (64%) were defined as high-risk based on disease specific IPI scoring systems. The mean CD4 count was 334 cells/\u03bcL at diagnosis and 10 (23%) patients had a CD4 count of 350 cells/\u03bcL and >200 cells/\u03bcL respectively. Conclusions A significant proportion of PLWH still present with aggressive lymphoma as an AIDS-defining event prior to HIV diagnosis, despite high levels of health education and healthcare availability. Our results appear equivalent to those for non-HIV patients with acceptable toxicity. Current Australian practice favors treating aggressive lymphomas in PLWH similarly to the HIV negative population, with the addition of concurrent ART. CD4+ T-cell-related immune reconstitution appears to recover within 6 months post-therapy. The OS of this cohort appears similar to the HIV negative population and published cohort studies (Coutinho AIDS 2013, Evens Blood 2019, Alderuccio Blood Adv 2021).
