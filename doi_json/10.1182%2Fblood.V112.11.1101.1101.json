    "abstract_text": "Bosutinib (SKI-606) is an orally available, Src/Abl kinase inhibitor with minimal activity against platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-kit. An open-label study of patients (pts) with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) accelerated phase (AP) and blast phase (BP) CML and Ph+ ALL who failed prior imatinib therapy is ongoing. Patients receive 500 mg/day of bosutinib. Preliminary data for 101 subjects, median age 51.5 yrs (range 18 \u2013 84 yrs) and 56% male are reported. 44 pts were in AP, 35 in BP, 21 had Ph+ ALL, and 1 was unclassified. Prior therapy in addition to imatinib included interferon (35 pts), dasatinib (40 pts), nilotinib (15 pts) and stem cell transplant (11 pts). 49 pts failed imatinib (and received no other tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI]) and 52 pts failed both imatinib and other TKIs, with median duration of bosutinib treatment to date 4.4 mos (range 0.3 \u2013 21.3 mos) and 2.0 mos (range 0.3 \u2013 18.8), respectively. Among pts with no TKI exposure other than imatinib, complete hematological response (CHR) was obtained in 12/25 evaluable pts (48%), including 7/11 pts (64%) with AP-CML, 4/11 pts (36%) with BP-CML and 1 pt with Ph+ ALL. Major cytogenetic response (MCyR) was achieved in 16/22 evaluable pts (73%) with no TKI exposure other than imatinib, including 9/13 pts (69%) with AP-CML and 6/8 pts (75%) with BP-CML; 1 pt with Ph+ ALL achieved MCyR. Major molecular response (MMR) was achieved in 9/25 evaluable pts (36%) with no TKI exposure other than imatinib, including 1/7 pts (14%) with AP-CML, 4/10 pts (40%) with BP-CML and 4/8 pts (50%) with Ph+ ALL. Among pts with other TKI exposure in addition to imatinib, CHR was obtained in 3/15 evaluable pts (20%), all with AP-CML; MCyR was achieved in 6/20 evaluable pts (30%), including 3/12 pts (25%) with AP-CML and 2/7 pts (29%) with BP-CML; 1 pt with Ph+ ALL achieved MCyR. Of the 20 pts with other TKI exposure in addition to imatinib who were evaluable for MMR, 1 pt with Ph+ ALL (5%) achieved this response. Of 60 pts with baseline samples tested for mutations, 15 different mutations were found in 32 pts (53%), including 8 instances of T315I. CHR occurred in 2/8 evaluable pts (25%) with non-P-loop mutations; the 1 evaluable pt with a P-loop mutation did not achieve CHR. MCyR occurred in 4/11 evaluable pts (36%) with non-P-loop mutations and in 1/2 evaluable pts (50%) with P-loop mutations. Treatment was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events among treated pts (n=101) were gastrointestinal (diarrhea [66%], nausea [46%] and vomiting [42%]) but these were usually grade 1 \u2013 2, manageable and transient, reducing in frequency and severity after the first 3 \u2013 4 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 \u2013 4 non-hematologic toxicities occurring in \u2265 5% of pts were diarrhea (7%), vomiting (6%), pneumonia (6%) and increased ALT (5%). Fluid retention was reported as grade 1 \u2013 2 in 18 pts and grade 3 \u2013 4 in only 3 pts (including 2 pleural effusions, neither related to bosutinib). Grade 3 \u2013 4 hematologic laboratory abnormalities reported include thrombocytopenia (68%), neutropenia (48%) and anemia (37%). 38 pts had at least 1 temporary treatment interruption and 22 pts had at least 1 dose reduction due to toxicity. 11 pts have permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse event. Bosutinib is effective in imatinib-resistant pts with advanced CML. Responses were observed across a wide range of Bcr/Abl mutations."
