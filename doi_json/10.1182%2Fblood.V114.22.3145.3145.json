MicroRNAs (miRs), the negative regulators of cellular mRNAs, control cellular expression of genes relevant to differentiation and apoptosis via mRNA degradation or inhibition of translation. Recent reports indicate that matured red blood cells (RBC) contain diverse population of miRs in abundance. Understanding the role of miRs in RBC during storage would perhaps provide insights into the mechanisms associated with storage lesions. Methods In this study, we utilized a membrane-based array to obtain differential miR profiles of 52-apoptosis-associated miRs in packed RBCs during storage. The packed RBCs were obtained from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) blood bank and stored at appropriate storage condition (4-8\u00b0C) for up to 40 days. Samples were collected at days 0, 10, 20, 30 and day 40 and subjected to miR analysis. Our rationale is that since miRs are regulators of apoptosis, profiling of apoptosis associated miRs in packed RBCs during storage would provide the first step towards understanding the underlying mechanisms associated with storage lesions. Results Our miR analysis identified perturbation of six miRNAs during packed RBC storage. Two miRs remain at high levels throughout the RBC storage period studied while four miRs demonstrated an upward trend from day 0 to day 40 of storage. TarMir bioinformatics-based target gene identification for miR-96 identified CASPN1 mRNA as its target. The presence of CASPN1 mRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR. Although this observation tempts us to speculate that an interaction of CASPN1 with miR-96 in stored RBC is possible, further experimental verification of this interaction is warranted. Conclusion The differential microarray analysis presented here suggest that further refinement of miR profiling of stored red blood cells could be of value as predictive markers of \u2018cellular status of RBC\u2019 during storage. Future experimental analysis of selected mRNA-miR interactions in packed RBC during storage would provide insights into the mechanisms of storage lesions The findings and conclusions in this abstract have not been formally disseminated by the Food and Drug Administration and should not be construed to represent any Agency determination or policy.
