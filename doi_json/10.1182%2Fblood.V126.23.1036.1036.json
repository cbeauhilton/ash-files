    "abstract_text": "\u03b1IIb\u03b23 is known to mediate adhesion of platelets to immobilized fibrinogen through its interaction with the C-terminal \u03b3 chain dodecapeptide (\u03b312) and EDTA inhibits the adhesion by binding divalent cations required for ligand interaction with the \u03b23 metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) cation. Studies by several groups, however, suggest that \u03b1II\u03b2b3 can also interact with other sites on fibrin(ogen). To identify potential additional sites of interaction between fibrinogen and \u03b1IIb\u03b23, we studied the adhesion of HEK293 cells expressing \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (\u03b1IIb\u03b23-HEK) to the D98 plasmin fragment of fibrinogen, which lacks the \u03b312 peptide. The D98 fragment did not contain the \u03b312 peptide as judged by both immunoblotting with mAb 7E9 (anti-\u03b312) and mass spectroscopy. \u03b1IIb\u03b23-HEK did not bind to immobilized D98 (10 \u00b5g/ml coating concentration) in the presence of 2 mM Ca 2+ /1 mM Mg 2+ , but they did bind to immobilized intact fibrinogen (10 \u00b5g/ml coating concentration) and the adhesion was inhibited by mAbs 10E5 (anti-\u03b1IIb\u03b23), 7E3 (anti-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 + \u03b1V\u03b23), and 7E9. Adhesion of \u03b1IIb\u03b23-HEK to fibrinogen was nearly eliminated by 10 mM EDTA [13,007 \u00b1 3,676 vs 304 \u00b1 331 arbitrary fluorescence intensity units (AFU); n=9; p<0.001]. Unexpectedly, and in dramatic contrast, 10 mM EDTA increased adhesion of \u03b1IIb\u03b23-HEK to D98 nearly 25-fold, from 458 \u00b1 601 to 10,718 \u00b1 3,106 AFU (n=9; p=0.001). The adhesion to D98 in the presence of EDTA was not inhibited by mAb 7E9 or mAb LM609 (anti-\u03b1V\u03b23), and was inhibited by mAb 7E3 by less than 10%. EDTA-dependent adhesion was, however, inhibited by mAb 10E5, which binds to the \u03b1IIb cap domain and inhibits fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23, by 85% \u00b1 4% (n=7; p=0.003). Dose-response experiments demonstrated that 3 mM EDTA was sufficient to block adhesion to fibrinogen and 3-4 mM EDTA was required to enhance adhesion to D98. Adding the \u03b23 D119 mutation to \u03b1IIb\u03b23-HEK (\u03b1IIb\u03b23-D119-HEK), which disrupts the MIDAS, eliminated adhesion to fibrinogen (\u03b1IIb\u03b23-HEK: 17,342 \u00b1 6,148 vs. \u03b1IIb\u03b23-D119-HEK: 0 \u00b1 241 AFU; n=3; p=0.006), but had little or no effect on the binding to D98 in the presence of EDTA (\u03b1IIb\u03b23-HEK: 11,363 \u00b1 3,700 vs. \u03b1IIb\u03b23-D119-HEK: 9,026 \u00b1 3,252 AFU; n=3; p=0.054). However, unlike EDTA-dependent adhesion of \u03b1IIb\u03b23-HEK to D98, the adhesion of \u03b1IIb\u03b23-D119-HEK was inhibited by mAb 10E5 by only 20% \u00b1 19% (n=3; p=0.247). We conclude that EDTA exposes one or more sites on \u03b1IIb\u03b23 that bind(s) to a site(s) on immobilized D98 that is either not accessible or not expressed on intact fibrinogen. These data are consistent with the known effect of EDTA in altering the conformation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 as judged by its exposing \"ligand-induced\" binding sites recognized by mAbs such as AP5 and PMI-1, even in the absence of ligand, and the ability of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 to mediate interactions with fibrin to support clot retraction even in the presence of EDTA. EDTA-treated \u03b1IIb\u03b23 may, therefore, provide insights into potential ancillary sites of interaction between \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and fibrin(ogen).
