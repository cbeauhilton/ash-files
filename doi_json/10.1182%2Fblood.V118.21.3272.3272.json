    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3272 Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by thrombosis and/or recurrent pregnancy loss in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA). The majority of APLA are directed against phospholipid binding proteins, particularly \u03b2 2 GPI. Anti-\u00df 2 GPI antibodies activate endothelial cells and monocytes in a \u03b2 2 GPI-dependent manner through a pathway that involves NF-\u03baB and leads to increased expression of adhesion molecules, tissue factor and proinflammatory cytokines. Kru\u0308ppel-like factors (KLFs) regulate endothelial cell and monocyte responses to inflammatory stimuli; increased expression of these transcription factors inhibits proinflammatory and procoagulant gene expression, and maintains vascular homeostasis. We recently reported that anti-\u00df 2 GPI antibodies decrease the expression of KLF2 and KLF4 in endothelial cells (Allen et al, Blood 2011), promoting endothelial cell activation. Subsequent studies demonstrate that these antibodies decrease expression of KLF2 in monocytes as well. Statins have been proposed as a potential alternative to anticoagulation for APS patients, and stimulate the expression of KLFs. We hypothesized that the ability of statins to block endothelial cell activation in response to anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies was mediated by KLFs. Treatment of endothelial cells and monocytes with 100 nM fluvastatin, lovastatin, or simvastatin upregulated KLF2 and KLF4 mRNA, even in the presence of anti-\u00df 2 GPI antibodies. In parallel, statin treatment inhibited the anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibody-mediated induction of E-selectin, VCAM-1, and TF mRNA in endothelial cells, and ICAM-1 and TF mRNA in human monocytes. To assess the dependence of these effects on KLF expression, endothelial cells were pretreated with KLF2 or KLF4 siRNA prior to treatment with statins. siRNA-mediated inhibition of KLF expression completely blocked the ability of statins to prevent anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibody-induced endothelial cell activation, as measured by adhesion molecule and TF mRNA levels and expression of E-selectin on the endothelial cell surface. Taken together, these data demonstrate that KLFs are critical modulators of the effects of statins on endothelial cells, and that increased expression of KLFs may represent a mechanism by which these drugs inhibit the activation of endothelial cells and monocytes by APLA/anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies.
