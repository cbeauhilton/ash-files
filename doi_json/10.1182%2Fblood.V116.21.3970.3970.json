    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3970 The objective of this paper is to study the biocompatibility and security of self-prepared magnetic nanoparticles Fe 3 O 4 (Fe 3 O 4 -MNPs) loaded with daunorubicin (DNR), which has the potential application in hematologic malignancies therapy. Hemolysis test was carried out to estimate it s blood toxicity; Fe 3 O 4 -MNPs loaded with DNR were intra peritoneally injected into mouse to calculate the LD 50 ; micronucleus (MN) assay was reckoned to identify its genotoxicity; acute toxicity testing was evaluated its influence to mouse hepatic and renal functions. The result of hemolysis rate (HR) of Fe 3 O 4 -MNPs loaded with DNR was 2.908%, far less than 5%. Therefore, we concluded that self-prepated Fe 3 O 4 -MNPs loaded with DNR nanoparticles had no hemolytic reaction, and they consistent with the requirement of hemolytic test of biomaterials. The LD 50 of Fe 3 O 4 -MNPs loaded with DNR nanoparticles to the mice was 1009.71mg/kg (relative content of DNR was 10mg/kg) and the 95% confidence interval was 769.11\u223c1262.40mg/kg, it had no significant difference compared with LD 50 of using DNR only, which data was 8.51mg/kg and the 95% confidence interval was 6.48\u223c10.37mg/kg, and it had wide safety value circumscription. In micronucleus assay, compared Fe 3 O 4 -MNPs loaded with DNR nanoparticles experimental groups with negative control group, we found that the result had no significant difference ( P > 0. 05) in micronucleus formation rate, while compared experimental groups with positive control group, the result had significant difference ( P < 0. 05). The result indicated that Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles had no cacogenesis and mutagenesis. Acute toxicity testing showed that mice body weigh of control group, Fe 3 O 4 -MNPs loaded with DNR nanoparticles experimental group and isodose DNR group had no significant difference in 24h, 48h, and 72h after intra peritoneally injection; they had normal activity, eating and evacuation; toxic reactions such as instability of gait, convulsion, paralysis and respiratory depression were not been found; the alanine transarninase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine clearance rate (CCr) of Fe 3 O 4 -MNPs loaded with DNR nanoparticles experimental group was 66.0\u00b128.55u/L, 9.06\u00b11.05mmol/L, and 18.03\u00b11.84umol/L, respectively, which had no significant difference compared with control group and isodose DNR group. From the results of our experiment, we could consider that self-prepared Fe 3 O 4 -MNPs loaded with DNR nanoparticles is a kind of high biocompatibility and security materials and perhaps is suitable for further application in hematologic malignancies therapy.
