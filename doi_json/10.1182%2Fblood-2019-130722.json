    "abstract_text": "Background : Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) in adult populations include several rare hematologic malignancies with similar clinicopathologic features that have a significant impact on patient QOL and lead to increased risk of infection, hemorrhage, anemia and transformation to AML (e.g. CMML, aCML, MDS/MPN-RST, and MDS/MPN-U). The only approved therapies for any of the MDS/MPNs are DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) for patients (pts) with CMML. Due to both the rarity and the heterogeneity of MDS/MPNs, it has been challenging to study in dedicated, prospective studies and thus refining treatment strategies has been difficult and optimal salvage treatments in pts who fail DNMTis have also not been rigorously studied. ABNL-MARRO (A Basket study of Novel therapy for untreated MDS/MPN and Relapsed/Refractory Overlap Syndromes) is an international cooperation providing the framework for clinical trials for MDS/MPN, and explore clinical-pathologic biomarkers. Study Design and Methods : The first study within ABNL-MARRO , ABNL MARRO 001 (AM-001), is an open label, randomized phase 1-2 study that will test 3 novel oral treatment combinations in MDS/MPNs, with each of 3 treatment arms including a novel targeted agent and ASTX727, a fixed dose combination of the DNMTi decitabine and the cytidine deaminase inhibitor cedazuridine to improve decitabine oral bioavailability. The novel agents combined with ASTX727 are: a selective JAK1 inhibitor itacitinib, pan PIM inhibitor INCB053914 and LSD1 inhibitor, INCB059872. Each combination will be tested first in a safety run-in (Phase 1b) to determine the RP2D and schedule of each combination therapy using a 3+3 de-escalation design, and a maximum of four dose decrements will be allowed. After the RP2D and schedule has been determined for a given novel drug combination, efficacy of that combination therapy in MDS/MPN pts will then be evaluated in phase 2 using a Simon's Two-Stage design to allow early discontinuation of any futile treatment regimen and to pursue potentially beneficial combinations in larger cohorts of pts. While each of the targeted agents either has undergone or is currently undergoing safety testing in combination with the DNMTi in myeloid diseases, clear rates of expected responses in MDS/MPN are not known. Retrospective studies of DAC or AZA reveal overall response rates (ORR) from 10-56% in CMML (Helbig et al, 2019; Duchman et al, 2018; Coston et al, 2019). The ORR from the ASTX727 single agent phase I study was 30%, but this included only 14% CMML (remainder MDS pts) and 45% of pts with previous treatment with AZA or DAC (Savona et al, 2019). Finally, and importantly, there are insufficient clinical trial data available for pts non-CMML MDS/MPN syndromes. Thus, the criteria for the Simon's Two-Stage design for each arm are based on best estimation from results of above studies. Accordingly, the null hypothesis that the ORR, as per the MDS/MPN Proposed Response Criteria (Savona et al, 2015; combined CR+MR+PR+Clinical benefit - CB), is 35%, will be tested against a one-sided alternative. In the first stage, 14 DNMTI-treatment na\u00efve (TN) pts will be accrued in each AM-001 Arm and will receive treatment at the RP2D and schedule of the novel targeted agent and of ASTX727, as determined in the phase 1. If there are 5 or fewer responses in these 14 pts before the 7th cycle of therapy, the Arm will be stopped for futility. Otherwise, 30 additional pts (including both TN subjects and subjects relapsed after/refractory to other DNMTI-containing therapies) will be accrued for a total of 44. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 21 or more responses are observed in 44 pts before the 7th cycle of therapy. This design yields a type I error rate of 0.05 and power of 80% when the true response rate is 55%. The probability of early termination and expected sample size of any arm is 64% and 25 pts, respectively, assuming low (35% RR) efficacy Beyond the primary objectives of the study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel treatment combinations in MDS/MPN, the study will establish the ABNL MARRO infrastructure that leverages the expertise of the MDS/MPN international working group (IWG) for future prospective studies; will forge innovative scientific research that will improve our understanding of pathogenetic etiologies; and will inform the clinical application of diagnosis, risk stratification tools, and response assessments in MDS/MPNs.
