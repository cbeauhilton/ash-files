    "abstract_text": "Introduction Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma associated with a poor prognosis. The approval of ibrutinib in November 2013 has changed the treatment paradigm for patients with relapsed or refractory MCL. There remains a lack of information on the current treatment patterns used in clinical practice in a contemporary cohort of commercially insured patients. We aimed to identify the treatment patterns for MCL overall and by line of therapy (LOT) and to describe patient demographics and clinical characteristics in a large cohort of commercially insured MCL patients. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted with the IQVIA Real-World Data Adjudicated Claims-US database. Adult patients (\u226518 years old) with \u22651 claim for a NCCN-recommended MCL treatment between November 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017 were identified. Index date was the first treatment claim. Patients were also required to have \u22651 diagnosis of MCL during the study period (November 1, 2012 to January 31, 2018), \u226512 months of continuous enrollment prior to index date (pre-index period) and \u226530 days after index date (follow-up period). Patients were excluded if they were \u226565 years at index and not enrolled in Medicare Risk or Medicare Cost, enrolled in a clinical trial during the study period, had evidence of MCL treatment in the pre-index period (except for patients indexed on ibrutinib as it is indicated for MCL patients with \u22651 prior treatment), or had evidence of stem cell transplant (SCT) before index date. The most commonly observed MCL treatment regimens were identified, and demographic and clinical characteristics of patients and treatment durations by regimen were described. Treatment regimen was defined as the combination of all agents observed in the 35-day period after the first MCL treatment claim; treatment duration was defined as the start of treatment until a gap of \u226590 days between end date and next date of treatment or treatment modification. Treatment end date occurred 90 days after the end of the supply for oral medications or 30 days after the last administration for non-oral medications. Results There were 1,785 patients treated with the most commonly observed MCL treatment regimens. The most common regimens, irrespective of LOT, were rituximab monotherapy (including maintenance therapy; n=773, 43.3%), R-CHOP (n=723, 40.5%), B-R (n=436, 24.4%), and ibrutinib monotherapy (n=199, 11.1%). Overall, patients had a median (IQR) age of 57 (52-62) years, and 59.4% were male. Most patients were commercially or self- insured (57.5% and 33.6%, respectively). Patients had a median Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of 0 (IQR 0-1; mean [SD] 0.9 [1.4]), with the most common CCI components being diabetes (15.7%), chronic pulmonary disease (12.8%), and congestive heart failure (9.5%). During the follow-up period (median [IQR] 22.5 [10.5-35.3] months), in addition to the MCL regimen(s), patients received radiation therapy (17.4%), SCT (10.0%), and/or immunotherapy (0.2%). The use of targeted therapies (i.e. lenalidomide, bortezomib) other than ibrutinib was infrequent. When considering treatment lines, R-CHOP was the most commonly observed first regimen, followed by rituximab, B-R, and ibrutinib; for the second and third observed regimens, rituximab was the most common, followed by ibrutinib (Figure 1). The median (IQR) duration for the first observed regimen was 8.1 (3.9-18.0) months for ibrutinib, 5.0 (3.3-5.6) months for B-R, 4.0 (2.5-4.4) months for R-CHOP, and 1.9 (1.7-4.4) months for rituximab; ibrutinib also had the longest duration in the second and third line (median [IQR] 5.5 [2.4-13.5] months and 8.3 [3.9-12.4] months, respectively). Conclusion This is the largest study of MCL patients describing treatment patterns in current clinical practice among commercially insured patients. MCL patients were most commonly treated with chemoimmunotherapy for all treatment lines while ibrutinib was the second most common LOT2 and LOT3 regimen. As the treatment landscape and clinical practice continues to change with the use of novel agents, future studies are warranted to further study toxicities and outcomes in the real-world setting.
