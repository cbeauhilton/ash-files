    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3340 Poster Board III-228 Aim: To identify factors predicting outcome of patients admitted to intensive care (ICU) following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Methods: Retrospective audit of all allo-HSCT patients requiring ICU admission. Results: Between 2000 and 2009, 392 patients underwent allo-HSCT. Of these, 106 (27%) had 129 ICU admissions. The median age was 47 (range 16-65) with myeloablative transplant in 89 and reduced intensity in 40 patients. Respiratory failure was the main reason for admission (54.6%) followed by sepsis (41.5%). During the period of ICU admission, 29.2% demonstrated improvement in organ failures, 39.2% remained stable and 28.4% deteriorated. Sixty-seven patients (51.9%) were discharged from ICU but only 48 (37%) were subsequently discharged from the hospital (ICU). Univariate analysis identified ICU admission within 30 days post HSCT, number of organ failures at admission, progression of organ failure during ICU admission, APACHE II score at admission, steroid refractory GVHD, and requirement for inotropic support or dialysis as significant predictors for survival in ICU. Patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation had a poorer outcome than the group who did not (84.4% Vs 20.0%, p=0.001). Those who required only non-invasive ventilation generally had a good outcome with 84.4% surviving til ICU discharge. While bacterial infection prior to ICU admission did not alter the outcome (p=0.221), the onset of a new infection in ICU was associated with a poor outcome (p=0.0001). Logistic regression analysis identified steroid refractory GvHD (P=0.027; 95% CI of 1.17-14.8), APACHE II score > 30 (p=0.003; 95% CI 1.5-10.5), admission <30 days post HSCT (p = 0.015; 95% CI 0.12-0.8), requirement of invasive ventilatory support (p = 0.005, 95% CI 2.58 \u2013 223.83) and dialysis (p = 0.011; 95%CI 1.401 \u2013 13.20) as significant factors for a poor outcome. Conclusion: More than 50% of patients admitted to ICU following allogeneic HSCT survive. A high APACHE II score, steroid refractory GVHD, admission into ICU within 30 days of HSCT, multiorgan failure, progression of organ failure during ICU stay, and the need for ventilation or dialysis, carries a dismal prognosis. Identification of risk factors associated with a poor outcome will assist in clinical management and may ultimately improve the outcome of patients requiring ICU admission following allogeneic HSCT.
