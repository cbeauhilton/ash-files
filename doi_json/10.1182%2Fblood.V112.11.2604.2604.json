    "abstract_text": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of duration of first remission (FR) on overall survival (OS) of patients (pts) with DLBCL in a population-based setting, and further to assess the possible differences in clinical features or IPI between pts with different duration of FR. We analyzed all DLBCL pts registered on the database of the Scotland and Newcastle Lymphoma Group. Further inclusion criteria were age >18 yrs and defined clinical stage (CS) at presentation, treatment with anthracycline based chemotherapy, and no immunotherapy or stem cell transplantation in first line treatment. According to duration of FR four groups were defined; \u201crefractory\u201d-pts who did not respond to first line treatment or relapsed within 9 months from diagnosis, \u201cearly relapse\u201d-pts who relapsed within 9\u201318 months from diagnosis, \u201clate relapse\u201d-pts who relapsed after 18 months from diagnosis and \u201cno relapse\u201d-pts who did not relapse. From 1990 to 2003, 2025 DLBCL pts were registered within the database and 1391 pts fulfill inclusion criteria. The median age at diagnosis was 64 yrs, 40% of pts were aged \u226460yrs, 51% of pts were male, 79% of pts had ECOG 60 yrs 46%, 7%, 9% and 38%, respectively. 5 yrs OS was 8% in \u201crefractory\u2013group\u201d, 16% in \u201cearly relapse\u2013group\u201d, 50% in \u201clate relapse\u2013group\u201d and 90% in \u201cno relapse\u2013group\u201d, differences between the groups were statistically significant, p60yrs 4%, 6%, 40% and 85%, respectively, p60yrs 32%, 50%, 76% and 68%, respectively, p60yrs, however there were no statistically significant differences between \u201cearly relapsed\u201d and \u201clate relapse\u201d groups. To assess the further potential differences in clinical features at presentation between \u201cprimary refractory\u201d vs \u201cno relapse\u201d pts and \u201cearly relapse\u201d vs \u201clate relapse\u201d pts, the groups were compared for the following factors: age, sex, CS, B-symptoms, ECOG, extranodal and bone marrow involvement, bulky disease, haemoglobin, leukocytes, LDH, albumin, urea, and alkaline phosphatase serum level. In evaluation of all pts and pts \u226460 years the \u201cprimary refractory\u2013group\u201d differed statistically significantly from the \u201cno relapse group\u201d in all evaluated factors except of sex and in evaluation of pts >60yrs in all factors. The \u201cearly relapse group\u201d differed statistically significantly from the \u201clate relapse group\u201d only in ECOG performance status in evaluation of all pts, CS and bulky disease in evaluation of pts \u226460 years and age and CS in evaluation of pts >60yrs. In a population-based study of pts with DLBCL treated with anthracyclines, duration of FR defined groups of pts with statistically different OS. It was impossible to distinguish entirely by clinical features or IPI at diagnosis. We conclude, that the currently used prognostic indices based on clinical factors need to be enhanced using biological features of the tumor.",
