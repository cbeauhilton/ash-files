    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapies and/or autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) are at risk for therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (tMN). As these agents yield increased mutation burden in relapsed malignancies and leave evidence of exposure via mutational signatures, we studied the genomic and temporal relationship between chemo exposure and progression of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) to tMN. Methods: We analyzed 32 tMN whole genomes (WG) from 31 patients [27 acute myeloid leukemias (AML), 4 myelodysplastic syndromes]. For 7 patients with tMN post-high-dose melphalan/ASCT, we investigated the presence of antecedent CH using targeted sequencing (MSK-IMPACT; Bolton et al. Nat Gen 2020) on pre-melphalan blood mononuclear cells, granulocytes, or CD34+ apheresis samples. Results: TMN was diagnosed a median of 4.2 years (IQR, 2.6-6.6) following primary treatment. When compared to data from 200 de novo AML from TCGA (NEJM, 2013), tMNs had fewer mutations in FLT3 (9.7% v 28.0%; p = 0.028) and NPM1 (3.2% v 27.0%; p = 0.003). TP53 loss was enriched in tMNs (25.8% v 10.5%; p = 0.035 ). Mutational signature analysis revealed 5 known single base substitution (SBS) signatures in tMN: the hematopoietic stem-cell (SBS-HSC), aging (SBS1), melphalan (SBS-MM1), and platinum signatures (E-SBS1, E-SBS20) (Rustad et al. Nat Comm 2020, Pich et al. Nat Gen 2019). Complex structural variants (SV), defined as \u22653 breakpoint pairs involved in simultaneous copy number changes (Rustad et al. Blood Can Disc 2020), were observed in 7 tMNs; including chromothripsis in 6 tumors (19.4%), chromoplexy in 2 (6.5%), templated insertion in 1 (3.2%), and unspecified complex SV in 2 (6.5%). Chromothripsis has not been previously reported in de novo AML and, in 4 cases, involved chromosome 19 with hyper-amplification of the SMARCA4 locus (\u22655 copies). CH variants that became clonal in tumor were seen in 5/7 pre-melphalan/ASCT samples and included mutations in TP53, RUNX1, NCOR1, NF1, CREBBP, DNMT3A, and PPM1D. Chemotherapy introduces hundreds of mutations, leaving each exposed cell with a unique catalogue (i.e., barcode). In fact, TMNs with evidence of chemo signatures had a higher mutation burden (median 1574 single nucleotide variants) than those without (median 938; p = 0.004). Detection of chemo signatures in bulk genome sequencing relies on one cell, with its catalogue of mutations, to expand to clonal dominance ( Fig 1a , Landau et al. Nat Comm 2020). Given the long latency between exposure and tMN diagnosis, this single-cell expansion model was expected for all samples exposed to melphalan or platinum-based regimens (i.e., agents with a measurable signature). Strikingly, all patients with pre-tMN platinum exposure (n=7) had evidence of platinum SBS signatures whereas only 2 of 7 patients with prior melphalan/ASCT had a melphalan signature (SBS-MM1). As all platinum-exposed tMN had mutational evidence of exposure, a CH clone must have existed prior to exposure, supporting a single-cell expansion model. Absence of a chemo signature for 5/7 post-melphalan/ASCT tumors despite exposure implies tumor progression driven either by multiple clones in parallel ( Fig 1b ) or by an unexposed clone. As latency largely excludes the former, this suggests pre-tMN CH clones were re-infused during SCT, thus avoiding chemo exposure ( Fig 1c ). This is supported by two lines of evidence: 1) tMNs from 2 patients exposed to sequential platinum and melphalan/ASCT had platinum but not melphalan signatures confirming single-cell expansion of the pre-tMN CH clone post-platinum but with escape from exposure to melphalan in the ASCT ( Fig 1d ); 2) targeted sequencing of pre-tMN samples from melphalan/ASCT patients identified tMN genomic mutations at the CH level in 5/7 cases, including in all 3 tested apheresis samples - one of which ( TP53 ) expanded to dominance without a melphalan signature. Conclusion: WG sequencing identified novel features of tMN revealing the key driver role of complex SV. Mutational signature analyses and targeted sequencing of pre-tMN samples can increase our understanding of tMN pathogenesis and demonstrate that tMNs arising post-ASCT are often driven by CH clones that re-engraft after escaping melphalan exposure. This mode of expansion suggests that a permissive, immunosuppressed, post-transplant environment might play a more important role than chemotherapy-induced mutagenesis in tMN pathogenesis.
