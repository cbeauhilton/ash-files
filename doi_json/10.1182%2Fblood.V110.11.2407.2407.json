    "abstract_text": "The Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase cascade and the Ras-PI3-K-Akt pathways are intricately regulated and evolutionarily conserved pathways that have been implicated in specialized cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, survival and degranulation. Recent data suggest that the strength and duration of these signals is maintained by extracellular growth factors and integrin stimuli as well as intracellular protein scaffolds. In the present study, we investigated the role of Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), a scaffold that appears to regulate both Ras-Erk and Ras-PI3-K activity in influencing mast cell function. In vivo, KSR\u2212/\u2212 mice have a 2\u20133 fold reduction of resident mast cells in multiple organs including the peritoneum and the skin as evaluated by scoring Alcian blue positive cells. To evaluate the mechanistic underpinnings of these in vivo observations, bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) were generated and proliferation, survival, degranulation, and migration was examined. A 3\u20134 fold reduction in kit-ligand mediated proliferation as measured by [ 3 H]thymidine incorporation was observed in KSR\u2212/\u2212 BMMCs as compared to WT BMMCs. In addition, a 50% increase in apoptosis was observed in KSR\u2212/\u2212 mast cells as compared to that in WT cells as measured by flow cytometeric analysis using Annexin/PI staining. Given that Erk and Akt are established molecular targets control proliferation and survival, respectively; we next performed western blots to evaluate if the changes in biological activity was associated with these signaling pathways. Importantly, a reduction in phosphorylation of ERK and phosphorylation of AKT was observed in the KSR \u2212/\u2212 BMMCs as compared to that in WT BMMCs. Given the role of PI3-K signals in mediating cytoskeletal organization in mast cells, we next tested whether the reduction in PI3-K signals was associated with a reduction in degranulation and migration. Following stimulation with kit-ligand and cross-linking of the IgE receptor, KSR\u2212/\u2212 mast cells were found to have a 30\u201350% decrease in b-hexosaminidase release. Moreover, KSR\u2212/\u2212 mast cells have up to a 5 fold reduction in migration to kit-ligand as measured over a range of kit-ligand concentrations. Collectively, the in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that KSR is an important regulatory kinase that may be a viable molecular target for modulating inflammatory mast cell functions."
