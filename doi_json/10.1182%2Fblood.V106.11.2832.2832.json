    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is tightly associated with chromosomal t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocations that result in the deregulated expression of the MYC (c- myc ) oncogene due to its juxtaposition to enhancers of the immunoglobulin-heavy chain locus IGH . The t(8;14)(q24;q32) MYC-IGH translocation is widely believed to be the initiating event in the pathogenesis of BL. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant neoplasm of plasma cells that is often associated with complex cytogenetic alterations that juxtapose MYC , analogous to the t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocation, to IGH enhancers. However, MYC-IGH rearrangements of this sort occur during the progression of MM, not as tumor-initiating events as in BL. Accurate mouse models of MYC deregulation associated with human BL and MM are needed to study the events involved in tumor initiation and progression and design new approaches for treatment and prevention. To that end, we have generated a new mouse model of human t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocation. Experimental procedure: We inserted a His 6 -tagged mouse Myc cDNA, Myc His , into two different locations of the mouse immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus, Igh , just 5\u2032 of E\u03bc or C\u03bc. In the latter case, E\u03bc was deleted during gene targeting. The newly developed gene-insertion strains were designated iMyc E\u03bc and iMyc C\u03bc . The iMyc E\u03bc mice provide a specific model of the t(8;14)(q24;q32) observed in endemic BL (eBL). The iMyc C\u03bc mice mimic the t(8;14)(q24;q32) found in sporadic BL (sBL) and immunodeficiency-associated BL (iBL) (Fig. 1).

However, in the E\u03bc-containing iMyc E\u03bc mice, tumors arose earlier and tumor incidence was higher compared to the E\u03bc-deleted iMyc C\u03bc (Fig. 2 left). Figure 2 View large Download slide Figure 2 View large Download slide Close modal This correlated well with the control of Myc His expression by E\u03bc, as Myc His mRNA levels were higher in B cells from iMyc E\u03bc than iMyc C\u03bc mice. Interestingly, the iMyc C\u03bc transgene was as effective in inducing inflammation-dependent peritoneal plasmacytomas as the iMyc C\u03bc transgene (Fig. 2 right). This indicated that host factors, such as chronic inflammation, can greatly enhance the transformation-inducing potency of a deregulated Myc gene that is only weakly oncogenic in spontaneous tumor development. Conclusion: The \u201ciMyc\u201d mice provide a model of Myc deregulation that is conducive to plasma cell tumors in mice. The mice may thus afford a good opportunity to identify the genes that collaborate with Myc in neoplastic plasma cell development. Combined with the transgenic expression of MM genes, such as DKK1 , the \u201ciMyc\u201d mice may also be useful as a platform for modelling human plasma cell neoplasms in mice.",
