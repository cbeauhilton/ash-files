    "abstract_text": "The proteins/peptides secreted from \u03b1-granules of activated platelets not only aid in thrombus formation and blood coagulation, but also exert various immune-modulating effects. Among many secreted products, Platelet Factor 4 (PF4), a chemokine that belongs to the CXC family, is one of the most abundant platelet proteins. While PF4 assignment to the chemokine family is based on its structural similarity with other CXC chemokines and chemotactic activity, to date no receptor for PF4 on leukocytes has been identified. Our recent elucidation of the recognition specificity of a major leukocyte integrin \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 (Mac-1) allowed the prediction that PF4 contains several putative Mac-1 recognition motifs and thus could potentially interact with this receptor. Using a peptide library spanning the sequence of PF4, we showed that the \u03b1 M I-domain of Mac-1 bound several overlapping PF4-derived peptides. The biolayer interferometry analyses demonstrated that PF4 bound recombinant active \u03b1 M I-domain of Mac-1 in a concentration-dependent manner with a K D of 1.3 \u00b1 0.2x10 -6 M. No interaction of PF4 with the inactive \u03b1 M I-domain (\u03b17 helix extended) or the \u03b1 L I-domain of a homologous integrin \u03b1 L \u03b2 2 was detected. The full-length recombinant PF4 and the \u03b1 M I-domain-binding peptide (residues 58-70) identified in the peptide library supported strong adhesion and spreading of Mac-1-expressing cells, including neutrophils, U937 monocytic and Mac-1-transfected HEK293 cells. The cell adhesion to PF4 was partially inhibited by anti-Mac-1 mAbs and completely blocked when anti-Mac-1 antibodies were combined with heparin, suggesting that cell surface proteoglycans act cooperatively with integrin Mac-1. PF4 induced a potent migratory response of wild-type, but not Mac-1-deficient, macrophages in a Transwell system. PF4 also enhanced phagocytosis: coating of E. coli bacteria or latex beads with PF4 enhanced ~ 4-fold their phagocytosis by macrophages, and this process was blocked by different Mac-1 antagonists. Furthermore, PF4 potentiated phagocytosis by wild-type, but not Mac-1-deficient, macrophages. These results identify PF4 as a ligand for integrin Mac-1 and suggest that many immune-modulating effects previously ascribed to PF4 are mediated via interaction with Mac-1.
