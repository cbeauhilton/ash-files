    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal hematologic malignancy characterized by genomic heterogeneity and epigenetic changes, including aberrant DNA hypermethylation. Phase-Ib clinical data in relapsed/refractory AML patients indicate that combining venetoclax with the hypomethylating agents (HMAs) 5-azacitidine (5-Aza) or decitabine results in an overall response (OR) of 62% (DiNardo et al. 2018) compared to the historical OR of 28-29% with HMAs treatment alone (Kantarjian et al. 2013; Dombret et al. 2015). Subsequently, a randomized phase-III clinical trial was initiated to evaluate venetoclax activity in combination with 5-Aza in treatment-na\u00efve AML patients ineligible for standard induction therapy (M15-656, NCT02993523). However, the underlying mechanism for the combinational activity observed between venetoclax and 5-Aza is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that both chronic low-dose 5-Aza treatment, which induced global DNA demethylation, and acute treatment (24 hours, non-epigenetic effects) can drive combinational activity with venetoclax in AML through distinct mechanisms. Chronic culture with a low-dose 5-Aza for one week sensitized AML cell lines to venetoclax in vitro . In contrast, acute treatment with 5-Aza, activated the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway to induce expression of the BH3-only proteins NOXA ( PMAIP1 ) and PUMA ( BBC3 ) in human AML cell lines, independent of DNA methylation. This resulted in an increase in the amount of NOXA and/or PUMA in complex with anti-apoptotic proteins like BCL-2, BCL-X L and MCL-1, thereby \"priming\" AML cells for induction of apoptosis by venetoclax treatment. Priming for apoptosis resulted in significant synergistic cell death in a panel of AML cell lines treated with venetoclax and 5-Aza in vitro . In this panel of cell lines, the level of the PMAIP1 , BBC3 , and DDIT3 gene induction correlated with the synergy observed between venetoclax and 5-Aza. Importantly, subsequent PMAIP1 deletion significantly impacted the kinetics and depth of apoptosis induced by 5-Aza or venetoclax alone or in combination. In accordance with the in vitro combinational activity, the venetoclax/5-Aza combination provided added benefit over either agent alone in two xenograft models of AML. Together, these data provide a rationale for an ongoing randomized phase-III clinical trial evaluating venetoclax activity in combination with 5-Aza (M15-656, NCT02993523).
