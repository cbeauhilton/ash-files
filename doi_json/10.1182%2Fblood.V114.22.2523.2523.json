    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2523 Poster Board II-500 Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a member of the eicosanoid family, is a local signaling molecule released from mammalian blood vessel walls and other hematopoietic niches. PGE2 produces tissue specific effects by interacting with G protein receptors in cell membranes. It has been found to be an important regulator of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) number during embryogenesis and is required for the development of HSCs (North et al., Nature 447:1007\u20131011, 2007). Additionally, PGE2 enhances HSC engraftment in competitive transplantation assays (North et al., Nature 447:1007\u20131011, 2007) through alterations in the survival, proliferation and homing of transplanted cells (Hoggatt et al., Blood 113:5444\u20135455, 2009). Immunoselected CD34+ cells were isolated from the leukapheresis products of both human and non-human primates following cytokine mobilization with G-CSF. CD34+ cells were incubated in X-Vivo 10\u2122 with either 50\u03bcM or no PGE2 for one hour at 37\u00b0C on RetroNectin\u2122 coated plates. After one hour incubation, media was replaced with X-Vivo 10\u2122 supplemented with 10ng/mL SCF and IL-6 and cells were kept at 37\u00b0C and collected either prior to or at 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours following PGE2 exposure. Total RNA was isolated from cells and amplified to cRNA. Control cRNA was labeled with Cy3 dye and experimental cRNA was labeled with Cy5 dye. Control and experimental labeled cRNA was co-hybridized to a custom-made 17.5K cDNA (UniGene cluster) microarray. The relationship between the cells was analyzed using an unsupervised Eisen's hierarchical clustering method and gene regulation was analyzed at each time point using an Array scatter plot comparison. Statistical analysis was done using Array Class Comparison analysis and pathway analysis was carried out using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Many of the significantly up regulated genes were associated with pathways activated by PGE2, including genes involved in the inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G proteins. Interestingly the human CD34+ cells showed at 2 hours a 21.8-fold increase of 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase mRNA consistent with prior observations in zebrafish and murine cells (Goessling et al. Cell 136: 1136\u20131148). Pathways that increased at 2 hours include molecular mechanisms of cancer, and those that were down regulated include CCR5, CTLA4, and leukocyte extravasation signaling. At 6 hours the molecular mechanisms of cancer pathway predominated even more (diminishing by 12 hours) while oxidative phosphorylation was down regulated. Genes involved in cAMP and WNT signaling are observed to be up regulated at earlier time points but diminish with time. These results correlate with protein expression observations that have been made in the zebrafish and murine models following PGE2 treatment (Goessling et al. Cell 136: 1136\u20131148) and are consistent with the observation that PGE2 may influence the self renewal of HSCs. Disclosures: Goessling: Fate Therapeutics: Consultancy, Patents & Royalties.",
