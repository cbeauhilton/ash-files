    "abstract_text": "Objectives. The number of transfusion is increasing faster than the rate of new blood donations. Further more, a transfusion excess, causing iron overload may have a deleterious effect on long term survival of patient with a malignant blood disease. We therefore tried to reduce the number of Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBC) by transfusing only one PRBC per transfusion instead of two. Material and methods. We conducted a prospective monocentric study between January and December 2013, with an historic comparative arm (from January 2010 to December 2012). We compared the number of PRBC transfused per hospital stay between two cohorts receiving only one PRBC per transfusion (Experimental arm or 1PRBC arm) or two PRBC per transfusion (Historical or 2PRBC arm). All patients admitted for remission-inducing therapy for acute leukemia or allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) aged \u2265 18 were eligible. The study was approved by local ethical committee. Transfusion triggers were hemoglobin lower than 80g/l or symptomatic anemia. Data analysis was performed in intention to treat. Results are mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Results. Seventy-five patients were included in the 1PRBC arm and 194 in the 2PRBC arm. Population distribution for sex, age, pathology and treatment was comparable between the two arms. There was no significant difference of transfused PRBC per hospital stay between the two groups. (7,92\u00b15,39 vs. 9,27\u00b17,42, 15% decrease. p =0,18). However, the restrictive strategy saved 1PRBC per hospital stay (estimated mean of 75 PRBC/year in our center). In the subgroup analysis, alloHSCT recipients from the 1PRBC arm (N=23) received significantly less PRBC than the 2PRBC ones (N=81) (4,13\u00b14,34 vs. 7,51\u00b18,96, 45% decrease. p =0,0058). Savings in this arm is 3 PRBC by hospital stay (estimated mean of 69 PRBC/year in our center). The number of adverse events and symptomatic anemia did not significantly differ between the two arms. Conclusion. A restrictive transfusion strategy is not inferior to a standard 2PRBC transfusion strategy and saves 1 CGR per hospital stay. This effect is especially patent in alloHSCT recipients. A prospective randomized multicentric study is ongoing to confirm these preliminary results. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
