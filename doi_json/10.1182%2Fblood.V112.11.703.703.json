    "abstract_text": "B-cell development takes place in the bone marrow and is defined by a number of sequential steps that include the up-regulation of CD19, the rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes (V(D)J recombination) and the expression of surface immunoglobulin. The early steps are regulated by cytokine signaling and the hierarchical expression of transcription factors, among them EBF, Pax5 and E2A and any interference with these critical elements leads to partial or total abrogation of B cell development. Here we present evidence that the POZ/BTB domain transcription factor Miz-1 (Zbtb17) represents an important novel regulator of the early development of follicular B cells. We have used gene targeting in mice to generate a non-functional allele of Miz-1 in all hematopoietic cells. In these mice, the development of adult follicular B cells is almost entirely abrogated, whereas the formation of marginal zone B-cells remain unaffected. Miz-1 deficiency correlated with the absence of CD19+ pro B-cells from the bone marrow and a block at the transition of the pre-pro-B cell to the pro-B cell stage. Although common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) that are at the origin of B-cell development were present in Miz-1 deficient mice, they showed decreased expression of E2A, EBF and Pax5 compared to their wild type counterparts. Moreover, they were unable to differentiate in culture into more mature B cells even on stroma cells (OP9) and the presence or absence of IL-7. Interestingly, a forced expression of EBF or PAX5 in Miz-1 deficient progenitor cells did not rescue this phenotype. Furthermore, fetal B cell development, which has been shown to depend on EBF and Pax5, is not altered in Miz-1 deficient mice, suggesting that Miz-1 acts in a pathway that is independent of these critical B-cell regulators. In contrast, however, to EBF and Paxc5, the co-expression of a Bcl-2 transgene almost completely restored the development of more mature CD19+ or IgM+ B-cells in Miz-1 deficient mice. This indicated that Miz-1 is implicated in the regulation of cell survival at early stages of B cell development. Since it has been shown before that Bcl-2 is a downstream effector of Miz-1, it is conceivable that Miz-1 regulates Bcl-2 in the early B cell precursors, possibly as an element of the IL-7 signaling pathway, and thereby ensures their survival and proper development. We conclude that Miz-1 represents a novel regulator of early B cell development that exerts its function at a precise step in adult mice independently of other well-established regulators of B-cell development such as EBF or Pax5.",
