    "abstract_text": "Background: MYC rearrangement is a recurrent somatic event in MM and results in super-enhancers repositioning within 3Kb (centromeric or telomeric) of the MYC locus. BRD4, a member of the bromodomain family, binds H3K27Ac and regulates enhancers activity, RNA polymerase II transcription initiation and elongation and in particular it regulates MYC transcription in MM cells. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) promote the proteasomal degradation of IKZF1/3 and the transcriptional repression of MYC and IRF4. However the exact mechanisms through which IMiDs downregulate MYC are not well understood. Methods and Results: Using a extended panel of 12 MM cell lines we have first confirmed our previous observartion that IMIDs universally degraded IKZF1/3, however unlike in IMiDs-sensitive cell lines it failed to downregulate MYC in resistant cells. Therefore, this finding suggests that MYC transcriptional regulation rather than IKF1/3 degradation is the \"bottleneck\" in IMiDs anti-myeloma activity or resistance. In addition, RNA-seq of paired and serially collected primary myeloma cells with acquired resistance to IMIDsconfirmed the enrichment of genes signatures associated with MYC at the time of acquired resistance. Of note, in a library of t(4;14) MM cell lines lenalidomide significantly downregulates FGFR3 while the expression of WHSC1 was not affected. As in t(4;14) cells FGFR3 is driven by the 3' IGH enhancer while WHSC1 is under the control of the intronic Em enhancer, and in view of the known role of IKZF1 in CSR, we posit that IKZF1 regulates plasma cells enhancer activity and hence MYC expression. To validate this hypothesis we first established the genome-wide distribution of IKZF1 in MM1S, RPMI8226 and OPM2 cells by ChIP-Seq. This analysis revealed the distribution of IKZF1 across the genome, predominantly to intronic an intragenic loci with only ~ 8% or reads mapping within +/- 5 kb of genes TSS. Importantly IKZF1 was also enriched at known myeloma cells enhancers or super-enhancers such as IGLL5, TXNDC5, BCL2L1, and DUSP22. We also mapped BRD4 binding to the genome in 8226 and MM1S cell lines and confirmed previously described mapping to known B-cell enhancers. Of note IKZF1 nearly universally overlapped with all BRD4 enhancers and superenhancers loci. These findings lead us to propose that IKZF1 depletion in response to IMiDs treatment will result in enhancer destabilization and displacement of BRD4 from enhancer loci. Indeed, Chip-Seq analysis of IKZF1 and BRD4 genomic distribution pre- and post- treatment with lenalidomide (10 uM for 4 or 8h) in IMiDs sensitive cell lines significantly depleted IKZF1 and BRD4 at superenhancer loci. In contrast, in IMiDs resistant cell lines (RPMI8226) and despite IKZF1 depletion, BRD4 was largely retained at these loci. These findings suggest that in IMiDs sensitive cells, IKZF1 is the major transcription factor mediating BRD4 recruitment to enhancer and superenhancer loci. In contrast, in IMiDs resistant cells and similar to BET-bromodomain inhibitor (JQ1) resistance, transcriptional plasticity or hyper-phosphorylation of BRD4 attributable to the phosphatase PP2A inactivation may also be mediating IMiDs resistance. Indeed the levels of p-BRD4 determined by western blotting were significantly higher in IMiDs resistant INA6 and RPMI8226 cells compared to MM1S cells. Furthermore, treatment of INA6 cells with the PP2A activator phenothiazine significantly sensitized INA6 cells to lenalidomide. Lastly, in order to investigate whether IMiDs resistance was associated with acquired new MYC rearrangements with an \"IKZF1_resisant enhancer,\" we performed mate-pair sequencing of IMiDs resistance patients (18 post acquisition of IMIDs resistance and 7 pairs of pre- and post- acquisition of IMIDs resistance). MYC structural rearrangements (indels, translocations, inversions) were detected using DELLY and MANTA. Of note several MYC rearrangement were identified including MYC duplication in 1 patient, MYC structural rearrangement (\u00b13Kb of TSS) in 9 patients (enhancer partner: TXNDC5, IGHa2, NSMCE2, IGLL5) and a newly acquired IRF4-IGH a2 rearrangement in 1 patient with pre-existing MYC-IGLL5 rearrangement. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that IMIDs alter enhancer activity in myeloma cells by depleting IKZF1 / IKZF3 and disrupting BRD4 binding to enhancers and super-enhancers, stalling of RNA polymerase II and MYC transcription.
