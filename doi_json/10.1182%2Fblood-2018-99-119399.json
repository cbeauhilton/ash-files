    "abstract_text": "Background: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) presents with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia and is caused by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. TTP can be the result of autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 or genetic defect in the ADAMTS13 gene. ADAMTS-13 is an enzyme that specifically cleaves unusually large von Willebrand Factor (VWF) multimers which mediate platelet thrombus formation under high shear. When ADAMTS13 is deficient, unusually large VWF multimers accumulate causing excessive platelet aggregation and thrombosis in the microvasculature. Methods: St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto is home to a large reference laboratory for special coagulation. We use a commercial ELISA Technoclone Technozym ADAMTS-13 activity assay for the determination of ADAMTS-13 activity and Technoclone Technozym ADAMTS-13 inhibitor assay to identify anti-ADAMTS-13 antibodies. We send samples to another Canadian laboratory for validation of our results as they use an in-house ELISA assay for ADAMTS13 activity and anti-ADAMTS13 antibody. Results: We performed a retrospective review of all ADAMTS13 activity tests performed by our laboratory between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2018. The total number of tests was 466 from 203 unique patients. 24% had an ADAMTS-13 activity under 10% (N = 144) which is consistent with the diagnosis of TTP. When specimens with severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency were tested for presence of anti-ADAMTS13 antibody, 46% were negative. Four of these specimens were sent to the other laboratory and all had detectable, albeit very low titre, inhibitors. Furthermore, on repeated testing over the study period, the vast majority of patients who presented with low ADAMTS13 activity and no detectable antibody subsequently became antibody positive. Fifty-two patients remained antibody negative by our internal and send-out testing. Five of them were known to have or were subsequently diagnosed with hereditary TTP (hTTP). Only one patient continues to have negative antibody but whose clinical course is not consistent with hTTP. Conclusions: We found that a commercial ADAMTS13 (Technoclone Technozym) antibody assay is falsely negative in a substantial proportion of patients with autoimmune TTP, the majority of which likely had a low titer inhibitor, below the threshold of test detection. More sensitive assays and/or repeated testing, presumably as inhibitor titre increases during the course of the disease, may detect antibody presence in the majority of samples of patients with autoimmune TTP. This is an important finding as this could impact the types of therapies offered to patients with negative antibody screens and may also avoid unnecessary, expensive genetic testing .
