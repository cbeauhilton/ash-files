    "abstract_text": "Background: Functional genomic screens elegantly increase our understanding of biology of leukemias. So far, CRISPR/Cas9 screens are widely performed in cell lines and in genetically engineered mouse models, in vitro and in vivo ; here, we extended their use to patient-derived leukemia cells in vivo . Methods Serially transplantable patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were generated from children and adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cas9 was stably expressed in PDX ALL cells using a split form of Cas9 assembled by inteins, facilitating lentiviral-mediated gene delivery. Customized sgRNA library was generated using golden gate cloning, at 5 sgRNAs per target gene. The sgRNA vector additionally expressed a fluorochrome marker and a tag, for sequential magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and flow cytometry (FACS) enrichment of sgRNA transduced PDX cells. Highly enriched Cas9/sgRNA double transgenic cells were transplanted into NSG mice and animals sacrificed after different periods of time. Cells were re-isolated from bone marrow, purified and subjected to PCR-based amplification of sgRNA library followed by next generation sequencing. Differential sgRNA distributions were analysed using a MAGeCK pipeline. Results We aimed to establish a comprehensive CRISPR screen pipeline allowing functional genomic screens in patients' acute leukemia cells. We investigated surface molecules required for cell homing and growth in mice, using a distinct customized sgRNA library. Quality controls of the sgRNA plasmid pool as well as transgenic PDX input samples verified standard distribution of all sgRNAs. As knockout was required at the time point of transplantation, conditions for prolonged culture of PDX ALL cells in vitro were optimized. Before injection into NSG mice, transduced PDX ALL cells were successfully enriched to above 95% using MACS and FACS. Over time in vivo , deep sequencing of re-isolated PDX cells revealed unchanged distribution of control sgRNAs, but strong loss of sgRNAs targeting CXCR4 and ITGB1, suggesting that CXCR4 and ITGB1 might be required for PDX ALL cell homing and engraftment. To validate the findings of drop-out CRISPR screen, we analyzed single sgRNAs targeting CXCR4 and ITGB1 in PDX cells. Competitive in vivo assays monitored by recombinant fluorochrome markers showed that the cells with CXCR4 or ITGB1 knockout had a significant disadvantage in vivo with respect to homing and growth in mice, compared to the control population. Taken together, we established a comprehensive workflow for CRISPR screen in PDX model of ALL in vivo . Our data identify and validate that CXCR4 and ITGB1 are required for homing and growth of PDX ALL cells in mice. Conclusion We show that CRISPR/Cas9 functional genetic screens are feasible in PDX acute leukemia models in vivo and report the first such screen, as far as to our knowledge. Extending CRISPR/Cas9 screens to patients' cells will greatly facilitate our understanding of individual leukemia biology and therapeutic targets in the future.
