    "abstract_text": "Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder and high-dose dexamethasone (HD-DXM) has been used as a first-line therapy for patients with ITP. However, little is known about the role of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T (Treg) cells, interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) in the pathogenesis of chronic ITP and the effects of HD-DXM on them contained Treg cells, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21. In this study, we investigated the expressions of Treg cells, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 in 26 untreated adult patients with chronic ITP. All patients had thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 \u00d7 10 9 /L) for more than 6 months. We also observed short time changes of Treg cells, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 after treatment with HD-DXM in these patients. The results showed that a good initial response to HD-DXM occurred in 24 of the 26 patients with chronic ITP (92.3%): the mean platelet count was (84.9\u00b130.4)\u00d710 9 /L [range, (20\u223c150) \u00d710 9 /L] one week after the initiation of treatment. The proportion of CD4 + CD25 + T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic ITP was significantly higher than that in normal controls( P <0.001); there was no significant difference in the percentage of CD4 + CD25 high T cells between patients and controls ( P =0.317); but the number of CD 4 + F OXP 3 + T cells in patients was significantly lower than that in controls ( P <0.001). After 4-days treatment with HD-DXM, the numbers of CD 4 + CD25 + T cells ( P <0.001), CD 4 + CD 25 high T cells ( P <0.001), and CD4 + F OXP 3 + T cells ( P <0.001) in patients were all significantly increased. In the serum of chronic ITP patients, the expression level of TGF-\u03b21 was lower than that of healthy controls ( P <0.0001) and HD-DXM could significantly increase it; there was no significant difference in the expression level of IL-10 between patients and controls ( P >0.05) and there was no remarkable change of IL-10 in patients after HD-DXM treatment ( P >0.05). The mRNA levels of Foxp3 and TGF-\u03b21 gene in patients were lower than those of controls ( P <0.05 and P <0.05); HD-DXM administration significantly increased the expressions of Foxp3 and TGF-\u03b21 gene( P <0.05 and P <0.0001), which were even higher than those of controls( P <0.05 and P <0.05); There was a positive correlation between the Foxp3 mRNA expression and TGF-\u03b21 after treatment with HD-DXM ( r =0.403, P =0.041). These results suggest that Foxp3 and TGF-\u03b21 gene are deficient in chronic ITP and the immunosuppressive therapy of glucocorticoids could improve the expression levels of these genes.",
