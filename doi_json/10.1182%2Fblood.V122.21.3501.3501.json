    "abstract_text": "The RGT sequences of the integrin \u03b23 tail directly and constitutively bind the inactive c-Src, regulating integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 signaling and platelet function. Previous work has shown that disrupting the interaction of c-Src with \u03b23 via myristoylated RGT peptide or deletion of the RGT sequences in \u03b23 selectively inhibits integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 outside-in signaling in platelets. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which the Src-\u03b23 association regulates integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 signaling need to be clarified. We found that active c-Src phosphoylated the Y 747 and Y 759 residues of \u03b23 directly at the in vitro protein/protein level or in CHO cell models bearing Tac-\u03b23 chimeras, which were devoid of the intact \u03b23 signal transduction. Furthermore, data from mass spectrometry, [\u03b3- 32 P] ATP incorporation assays and CHO cell/Tac-\u03b23 chimeras demonstrated that the direct phosphorylation of Y 747 and Y 759 by active c-Src did not depend on the binding of c-Src to the RGT sequences of the \u03b23 tail. To further investigate the biological functions of Src-\u03b23 association in signal transduction we employed a cell-permeable and reduction-sensitive peptide (myr-AC\u223cCRGT), which disrupted the Src-\u03b23 association in platelets independent of membrane-anchorage, and found that when platelets were stimulated by thrombin the c-Src activation and the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues of the \u03b23 tail were substantially inhibited by the presence of the peptide. These results suggest that one of the crucial biological functions of Src-\u03b23 association is to serve as a \u201cbridge\u201d linking integrin signaling with the c-Src full activation and phosphorylation of the tyrosines of the \u03b23 tail. To answer whether the RGT peptide binding to Src is able to alter the enzymatic activity of c-Src, we examined the Src-Csk association, the phosphorylation status of Y 416 and Y 527 of c-Src and the c-Src kinase catalytic activity. Results showed that myr-AC\u223cCRGT did not dissociate Csk from c-Src in resting platelets and the phosphorylation level of Y 416 and Y 527 of c-Src remained unaltered. Consistent data were also obtained from in vitro analysis of the c-Src kinase catalytic activity in the presence of CRGT peptide. These results suggest that myr-AC\u223cCRGT peptide per se does not fully activate c-Src. Myr-AC\u223cCRGT was also found to inhibit integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 outside-in signaling in human platelets. To examine the effect of the myr-AC\u223cCRGT on platelet adhesion and aggregation under flow conditions, we measured the platelet thrombus formation under different shear rates . Myr-AC\u223cCRGT did not affect the platelet adhesion at a wall shear rate of 125 s -1 . The inability of myr-AC\u223cCRGT to affect platelet adhesion and aggregation remained at 500 s -1 shear rates. At 1,500 s -1 , or 5,000 s -1 rates, myr-AC\u223cCRGT partially inhibited platelet adhesion and aggregation. These observations indicate that the Src-regulated outside-in signaling plays a pivotal role in the stable thrombus formation and the thrombus growth under flow conditions. The present study reveals novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which c-Src regulates integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 signaling, particularly the phorsphorylation of the \u03b23 cytoplasmic tyrosines, and provides first evidence in human platelets that the RGT peptide or derivatives regulate thrombus formation through dissociating the Src-\u03b23 interaction. The data of this work allow us to anticipate that intracellular delivery of the RGT peptide or its analogues may have potential in the development of a new antithrombotic strategy where only the Src-\u03b23 interaction is specifically interrupted so as to provide an effective inhibition on thrombosis together with a decent hemostasis.
