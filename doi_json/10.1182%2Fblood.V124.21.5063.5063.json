Our study objectives were to analyze the characteristics of Intracranial haemorrhage in haemophilia children. Methods: Intracranial haemorrhage cases in haemophilic children were retrospective analyzed from Jan. 2008 to Dec. 2013. Patients with sever trauma inhospitalized in the surgical department were excluded. Results: Of 439 severe or intermediate haemophilic children 29(6.6%) experienced 32 events of ICH. The 29 children included 20 haemophilia A boys and 9 heamophilia B boys. The age of onset of ICH from 1 month to 17 years old (mediate age 3 years old). Head trauma histories was found in 79.3% (23/29) children 1 day to 1 week before ICH. Of 29 patients 15 (51.7%) had the presentation of convulsion or coma. The haemorrhage site included 2 events in extradural, 2 events in subdural, 6 events in brain parenchyma, 1 event in subarachnoid space, 21 events had multiple sites ICH. The ICH mortality was 6.9% (2/29). Only two children had done prophylaxis treatment with low dose (10-15u/kg, 2/w) before ICH. Inhibitor were only tested in 8 children who were all positive when ICH occurred. Conclusion: The most significant risk factors for ICH included the presence of an inhibitor and reported head trauma. Our patients with ICH had low mortality maybe because most patients had no inhibitor who could have good response to factor treatment, and these patients had excluded patients with sever trauma in the surgical department.
