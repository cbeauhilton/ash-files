    "abstract_text": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mediate growth of MM cells via activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), JAK2/STAT3, and phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase/Akt kinase (PI3-K/Akt) signaling cascades. We have previously demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo activity of Revlimid\u2122 (CC-5013), an immunomodulatory analog (IMiD) of thalidomide, in MM. In the present study, we have examined the anti-MM activity of rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor, combined with Revlimid\u2122. This combination was highly synergistic at 0.1nmol/L of rapamycin with 0.1mmol/L of Revlimid\u2122, and remained synergistic at higher concentrations. Based on the Chou-Talalay method, combination indices of < 1 were noted for all dose ranges of Revlimid\u2122 and rapamycin, suggesting strong synergism. Importantly, this combination was able to overcome drug resistance when tested against MM cell lines resistant to conventional (doxorubicin, melphalan, dexamethasone) chemotherapy. Moreover, the combination, but not rapamycin alone, was able to overcome the growth advantage conferred on MM cells by IL-6, IGF-1, or adherence to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Cytotoxicity triggered by a combination of rapamycin with Revlimid\u2122 resulted in apoptosis of MM cells. Furthermore, differential signaling cascades, including the MAPK and PI3-K/Akt pathways, were targeted by these drugs individually and in combination, suggesting the molecular mechanism by which they interfere with MM growth and survival. These studies therefore provide the framework for the clinical evaluation of targeted agents like mTOR inhibitors combined with immunomodulatory agents like Revlimid\u2122 to improve patient outcome in MM.",
