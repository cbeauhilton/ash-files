This investigation was conducted because of concerns of altered pharmacokinetics and a lack of safety and efficacy data when used in children. Patients and Methods: Data of 126 children and adolescents with a median age of 5.9 years receiving enoxaparin either as a once or twice daily dosing regimen were analyzed. Children < 12 months of age received a starting dose of 1.5 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 1.3 mg/kg. Children > 12 months of age were started on 1 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 1 mg/kg. Blood samples were drawn after patients reached steady-state on their maintenance dose at baseline prior to the next dose, and at 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after administration. The median enoxaparin concentration in our population resulted in a median anti-factor Xa activity of 0.4 U/ml (range 0 \u2013 1 U/ml anti-factor Xa). By means of population pharmacokinetics using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling (NONMEM) plasma concentration-time data were analyzed. Several covariates such as age, body weight and body surface area were tested on their effects on the pharmacokinetic parameters. Results: Using a two-compartment model the enoxaparin kinetics were described sufficiently. By using body weight and age as covariates for clearance (CL) and central volume of distribution (V 1 ) the best results were obtained. The final population estimates of enoxaparin resulted to be: CL 7.11 ml h -1 kg -1 \u00b1 14.3%, V 1 7.31 ml kg -1 \u00b1 33.5%, intercompartimental clearance (Q) 194 ml h -1 \u00b1 24.7%, peripheral volume of distribution (V 2 ) 45.1 l \u00b1 52.5% and absorption rate (k a ) 0.0799 h -1 \u00b1 21.7% (estimates \u00b1 standard errors). Interindividual variability (IIV) was found to be 75.6% for CL and 78.4% for Q, respectively. Figure 1 shows the predicted activity time-course versus the measured activities for a representative patient. The model is capable of describing all aging and dosing groups of our childhood population (neonates, infants to adolescents). Conclusion: The high IIV in CL and Q in our population underlines the need for monitoring the activity and individualizing the dose. Further population pharmacokinetic/-dynamic investigations should be conducted to predict target enoxaparin levels or other new antithrombotic drugs for more safety and efficacy during antithrombotic therapy when used in children.
