    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3722 Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (rituximab or ofatumumab) are being successfully used in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). They exert antitumor effects by triggering indirect effector mechanisms of the immune system, such as activation of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), or immunophagocytosis. Moreover, upon crosslinking with secondary antibodies, anti-CD20 mAbs can induce cell death. It is frequently underscored that CD20 expression levels in various B-cell tumors is relatively constant. However, accumulating evidence indicates that CD20 can be modulated at transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and even posttranslational levels. Moreover, it has been clearly shown in vitro that CDC efficacy of anti-CD20 mAbs clearly depends on CD20 expression. We have previously observed that statins impair detection of CD20 in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells and impair rituximab-mediated CDC and ADCC (Winiarska et al. PLoS Med 2008). Statins are inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis and decrease production of prenyl groups (farnesyl and geranylgeranyl PPi), which are necessary for posttranslational modification of approximately 1% of cellular proteins. In experiments aimed at elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of statin-mediated modulation of CD20 we observed that neither geranylgeranyl transferase (GGT) nor farnesyl transferase (FNT) inhibitors could mimic statins effects. On the contrary, prenyltransferase inhibitors improved rituximab-mediated CDC. Therefore, we decided to investigate in more detail the interaction of prenyltransferase inhibitors and anti-CD20 mAbs. In the initial experiments we evaluated the effects of three different farnesyl transferase inhibitors as well as three different geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors. Among all FNT and GGT inhibitors, L-744,832 seemed to produce the most significant influence on both rituximab-mediated CDC and CD20 levels ( Figure ). Moreover, L-744,832 significantly increased rituximab-mediated CDC in 3 out of 5 primary tumor cell cultures isolated from patients with NHL or CLL. Therefore, L-744,832 was selected for further more systematic studies. Interestingly, in Raji cells L-744,832 did not improve rituximab-mediated ADCC and only at the highest non-toxic concentrations it sensitized to rituximab+crosslinking antibody-mediated cytotoxicity. In 10 out of 17 (58.8%) primary lymphoma/leukemia cells L-744,832 increased CD20 expression by at least 20% as measured with flow cytometry. Moreover, we observed that upon L-744,832 treatment CD20 is up-regulated in Raji cells at both mRNA as well as protein level. Experiments aimed at investigation of FTI influence on proteasome activity as well as CD20 endocytosis and shedding revealed that L-744,832 influences CD20 levels independently from its posttranslational regulation. To verify whether modulation of CD20 levels by L-744,832 results from specific inhibition of farnesyltransferase or is an off-target effect of this compound we performed FNT B subunit (FNTB) knock-down experiments that resulted in increased CD20 levels by almost 60%. Incubation of Raji cells with a transcription inhibitor cycloheximide completely prevented L-744,832-mediated increase of CD20 levels in WB. Therefore, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to determine whether inhibition of FNT activity is associated with binding of transcription factors to the promoter of cd20 gene. These studies revealed that L-744,832 promotes binding of PU.1 and Oct2, but not TFE3 to target DNA sequences within cd20 promoter in Raji cells. To conclude, our studies indicate for the first time that CD20 expression can be modulated by prenyltransferase inhibitors. While inhibition of FNT activity significantly up-regulates expression of CD20, the influence of GGT inhibitors on this protein is more complex, and requires further studies. Furthermore, pre-incubation of NHL and CLL cells with L-744,832, a FNT inhibitor, potentiates anti-CD20 mAb-mediated activation of the complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Therefore, the combination seems to be promising and its efficacy should be determined in patients with NHL or CLL.
