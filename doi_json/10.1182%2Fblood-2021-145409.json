    "abstract_text": "Background: SCD is an inherited blood disorder that for many patients (pts) has a high clinical burden, results in poor quality of life (QoL), and reduces life expectancy. Gaining a deeper understanding of pt and HCP experiences of SCD is important to improve pt management. Aims: SWAY was a cross-sectional survey that assessed pt and HCP experiences of SCD. Here we focus on the experiences of HCPs from various regions on SCD symptoms and complications, impact of SCD on QoL, treatment goals and treatment satisfaction. Methods: SWAY was developed by international SCD expert physicians, pt advocates and Novartis. HCPs completed the survey between Apr and Oct 2019. Eligible HCPs had qualified in their primary specialty by 2014 and were managing \u226510 SCD pts at the time of survey (\u22655 pts per HCP in Canada; \u22652 pts in the Netherlands). Responses to questions on how much SCD impacts pt QoL, and on HCP treatment satisfaction, were ranked on a Likert scale (1-7, where 1=not at all/strongly dissatisfied, 7=a great deal/strongly satisfied; 5-7 indicated high impact/satisfaction). The data reflect only the experiences of the surveyed HCPs in each region (recruited by Adelphi Real World fieldwork). A limitation is that Asia and South America (SA) were represented by single countries (India and Brazil, respectively). Results: SWAY was completed by 365 HCPs from 6 regions (Table). In all regions HCPs recognized the prevalence of acute and chronic pain, however acute pain was reported less frequently by HCPs in Africa than in other regions (Table). Acute chest syndrome and joint issues were among the top 5 most frequently mentioned complications by HCPs in all regions. Globally, HCPs recognized the high impact of SCD symptoms and complications on pt QoL and the high negative impact of SCD on pt emotional wellbeing (Likert score 5-7 reported by 79-100% and 71-97%, respectively). Fewer HCPs in the Middle East (ME) reported a high impact of SCD on physical and sexual activity, compared with HCPs in other regions. Around 40% of HCPs in the ME and Asia thought SCD has a high impact on daily activities, compared with 79-90% of HCPs in other regions. In Asia, fewer HCPs reported that SCD has a high impact on pts' education and ability to maintain a job compared with HCPs in other regions (Figure). Hydroxyurea (HU) was among the top 3 most common therapies ever initiated and was the therapy most likely to be initiated in any age group by HCPs in almost all regions. In Africa, the most common therapy ever initiated and the therapy most likely to be initiated in any age group was opioids (Table). Fewer HCPs in North America (NA; 32%) and SA (27%) were highly satisfied with current SCD treatments, compared with HCPs in other regions (46-72%). The main reason for dissatisfaction was limited treatment options in all regions except Asia, where HCPs said they were unable to reach their treatment goals with current therapies. Improving pts' QoL was among the top 3 treatment goals for 51-84% of HCPs across all regions. For HCPs in NA and the ME, the most important goal when treating vaso-occlusive crises was to improve QoL; in SA, Europe and Asia it was to avoid organ damage; and in Africa it was to eliminate pain completely. Discussion: The top 5 most frequent SCD symptoms and complications that HCPs reported were similar across all regions. There were regional differences in HCP experiences of how SCD impacts aspects of pts' daily life, with fewer HCPs in the ME reporting a high impact on physical and sexual activity, and fewer HCPs in Asia and the ME reporting a high impact on daily activities compared with other regions. This may be due to cultural variations, with pts in these regions being less comfortable discussing these topics with HCPs. There was a difference in the reported impact of SCD on school and work between HCPs in Asia and other regions, which could be due to varying expectations regarding school/work productivity. HU was one of the top 3 most common treatments ever initiated by HCPs for pts of any age, except in Africa, which may be due to an educational knowledge gap about HU, high cost, or poor access in this region. HCPs in almost all regions, except Asia, were dissatisfied with current SCD treatments because of limited therapeutic options, indicating a global unmet need for additional treatment choices. Improving QoL was the most important treatment goal for HCPs in all regions, demonstrating the high negative impact that SCD has on pt QoL and the ongoing need for methods to address this.
