    "abstract_text": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a chromosomal instability disorder characterized by a progressive bone marrow (BM) aplasia. Previous studies from our lab and others suggest that enhanced oxidant- and inhibitory cytokine-mediated apoptosis of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells are important mechanisms in the pathogenesis of BM failure in FA. Recently, we showed that oxidant-induced apoptosis in Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) was mediated through hyperactivation of the redox-dependent protein, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1, Saadatzadeh et al, JBC 2004 ). Here, we tested whether alterations in ASK1 signaling also participate in the pro-apoptotic phenotype of primary Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 MEFs and progenitors in response to the inhibitory cytokine, TNF-\u03b1. To determine whether Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 MEFs exhibit altered ASK1 signaling after TNF-\u03b1 treatment, we examined ASK1 activity using in vitro kinase assays. These studies demonstrated a 2\u20133 fold increase in TNF-\u03b1-induced ASK1 activity in Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 MEFs compared to WT (n=5). Consistent with ASK1 hyperactivation, we observed an increase in activation of the downstream stress kinases, c-jun N-terminal kinase and p38, in Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 MEFs compared to WT (n=5). Utilizing a dominant negative ASK1 cDNA to decrease ASK1 activity, we determined that TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis in Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 MEFs was ASK1 dependent (n=3, p<0.05). In addition, TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis in Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 MEFs was completely blocked by both antioxidants (selenomethionine and N-acetylcysteine, n=3, p<0.001) and the p38 inhibitor SB 203580 (n=6, p<0.001). To examine whether ASK1 has a critical role in the hypersensitivity of Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 progenitors to TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis, we crossed ASK1 knockout mice with Fancc mice to generate the following four experimental genotypes; WT, Fancc +/+;ASK1 \u2212 / \u2212 , Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 ;ASK1 +/+, and Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 ;ASK1 \u2212 / \u2212. BM cellularity and progenitors/femur were similar between all genotypes (n=3). Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1 hypersensitivity of Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 progenitors was restored to WT levels when ASK1 was deleted (n=3, p<0.05), suggesting that TNF-\u03b1-induced hypersensitivity of Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 progenitors is mediated through ASK1, similar to Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 MEFs. In addition, TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis in Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 progenitors was restored to WT levels after culturing with the p38 inhibitor SB 203580 (n=6, p<0.005). Since ASK1 activity is directly regulated by the cellular redox state, these data support the idea that aberrant redox regulation may be involved in the observed pro-apoptotic phenotype of Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 cells after exposure to inhibitory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1. Collectively, these data suggest that inhibiting the ASK1 apoptotic pathway in Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 cells via antioxidants or small molecule inhibitors may protect Fancc \u2212 / \u2212 hematopoeitic stem/progenitors from an apoptotic fate and delay BM failure.",
