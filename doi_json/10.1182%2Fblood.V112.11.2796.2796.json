    "abstract_text": "In Primary Myelofibrosis, several lines of evidence suggest that pleiotropic cytokine TGF-\u03b21, released by clonal proliferation of pathological megakaryocytes and/or monocytes, plays a prominent role in reticulin fibers deposition. This cytokine is synthesized as a biologically inactive molecule that needs to be activated in order to trigger biological responses. However, the mechanisms involved in local TGF-\u03b21 activation within the hematopoietic environment remain unclear. Since TGF-\u03b21 and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) are synthesized and stored within the same organelles in megakaryocytes, one can speculate that the abnormal release of both molecules leads to pathological local TGF-\u03b21 activation that becomes ultimately responsible of fibrosis development in the vicinity of these cells. To investigate the role of TSP-1 in local TGF-\u03b21 activation, we used the TPO high murine model of bone marrow (BM) fibrosis. BM cells from wild-type (WT) or Tsp-1 -null male littermates were infected with a retrovirus encoding the murine TPO protein and engrafted into lethally irradiated WT or Tsp-1 -null female hosts, respectively, leading to the following engraftment combinations, WT/WT (WT TPO high mice, n=21) and Tsp-1 -null/ Tsp-1 -null ( Tsp-1 -null TPO high mice, n=17). Lethally-irradiated hosts were engrafted with 4 to 8 \u00d7 10 6 cells in 3 independent experiments. Peripheral blood was analyzed every 4 weeks during 3 months and mice were killed for histological analysis at week 8 and 12 post-engraftment. The magnitude of plasma TPO level increase was comparable regardless of the TPO high mice groups. Chimerism levels, analyzed in recipients by FISH on the presence of the donor Y chromosome in whole nucleated BM cells, were more than 90% in either WT or Tsp-1 -null TPO high mice. We report here that all TPO high mice developed a similar myeloproliferative syndrome associated with TGF-\u03b21 overproduction. Surprisingly, we were able to detect the active form of TGF-\u03b21 in BM and spleen extracellular fluids in all mice, including Tsp-1 -null TPO high mice, suggesting that alternative mechanisms are mainly responsible for local TGF-\u03b21 activation in this murine model of myelofibrosis. We then confirmed that Tsp-1 -null platelets are able to activate TGF-\u03b21 in vitro in response to thrombin. As predicted by the detection of the active form of TGF-\u03b21, Tsp-1 -null TPO high mice developed BM and spleen fibrosis which appears, intriguingly, to be of a greater grade than the one displayed by WT TPO high mice. Since TSP-1 is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, we investigate whether this increased fibrosis could be correlated with an augmentation of neoangiogenesis. The microvascular density (MVD) in control Tsp-1 -null BM were higher than in control WT one (10\u00b14.7 vs 0.6\u00b10.2; p<0.001), as expected. However, MVD displayed by Tsp-1 -null TPO high mice (8.3\u00b14.4) did not rise above the one displayed by control Tsp-1 -null mice and was similar to MVD observed in WT TPO high mice (5.7\u00b12.9). Thus, the increase of myelofibrosis in Tsp-1 -null TPO high mice cannot be explained by an augmentation of neoangiogenesis. Since TGF-\u03b21 levels were similar in both TPO high groups, we hypothesized that this increase could be related to an enhanced TGF-\u03b21-mediated response by Tsp-1 -null BM fibroblasts. Indeed, we could show that Tsp-1 deficiency is associated with sustained phospho-Smad3 levels and a 10-fold increase in collagen III transcription level by BM fibroblasts in response to TGF-\u03b21. Together, our results show that TSP-1 is not the major activator of TGF-\u03b21 in this in vivo model of myelofibrosis; suggest that other mechanisms are involved in this activation; shed light on a possible new mechanism of TGF-\u03b21 regulation by one of its own activator.",
