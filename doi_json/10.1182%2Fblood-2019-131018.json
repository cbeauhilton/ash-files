    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy and is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. Although a majority of patients achieve remission following cytotoxic chemotherapy, most will relapse and ultimately die. Therapy resistance and relapse are driven by leukemia stem cells (LSC). Evidence of genetic and functional heterogeneity in the LSC compartment underscores the importance of developing therapeutic strategies that will target all subclones effectively. We previously showed that LSCs in AML depend on CD47-SIRP\u03b1 interaction to evade immune surveillance (Theocharides et al, JEM 2012). CD47 acts as a \"do not eat me\" signal that binds to the inhibitory receptor SIRP\u03b1 on macrophages and masks cancer cells from macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. TTI-621 (Trillium Therapeutics Inc., Ontario, Canada) is a human SIRP\u03b1Fc protein formed by fusing the IgV doman of human SIRP\u03b1 to a human IgG 1 -Fc moiety; it is designed to bind CD47 on leukemia cells and disrupt its interaction with SIRP\u03b1 on host macrophages. Our previous studies in AML cell lines and a small number of primary AML samples demonstrated increased phagocytosis in vitro and decreased engraftment in xenotransplant models following SIRP\u03b1Fc treatment (Theocharides et al, JEM 2012, Petrova et al, Clin Cancer Res 2017). Here, we tested the efficacy of TTI-621 against a broad panel of primary AML samples in xenotransplantation models to determine efficacy and response rates in this heterogeneous disease. Bulk cells obtained from the peripheral blood of 30 AML patients representing a broad range of cytogenetic and molecular subtypes were transplanted intrafemorally into sublethally-irradiated NSG mice. After a 2-week engraftment period, mice were treated with either SIRP\u03b1Fc or control IgG by intraperitoneal injection 3\u00d7/week for 4 weeks, following which leukemic engraftment was determined by flow cytometry. In all but 1 sample, a significant reduction in AML engraftment was seen in SIRP\u03b1Fc-treated mice compared to controls. For 23 samples defined as good responders, SIRP\u03b1Fc treatment resulted in 91% (range 53-100%, p60, adverse cytogenetic risk, and secondary AML, as well as samples obtained from relapsed/resistant patients, were classified as good responders. Notably, 20 of 23 good responders had a high LSC17 score, which we have shown is associated with poor initial therapy response and short survival following standard treatments (Ng et al, Nature 2016). To determine whether SIRP\u03b1Fc treatment killed LSCs, we transplanted leukemia cells harvested from primary treated mice into untreated secondary recipients at limiting dilution. For four independent samples, including three partial responders and the one non-responder, we observed a significantly lower LSC frequency (3.9-10.3 fold, p=0.002-0.024) in mice transplanted with SIRP\u03b1Fc-treated cells compared to controls, indicating that SIRP\u03b1Fc treatment reduced LSC numbers in primary mice, despite partial or no reduction of bulk disease. Our data demonstrate that SIRP\u03b1Fc effectively targets LSCs in a human AML xenotransplantion model with high response rates across a heterogeneous cohort of primary AML samples, including samples with unfavorable risk features. SIRP\u03b1Fc may be most effective in the remission setting as maintenance therapy for patients with detectable residual disease, to eradicate residual LSCs and prevent relapse.
