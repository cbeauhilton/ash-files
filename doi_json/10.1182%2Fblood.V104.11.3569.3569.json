    "abstract_text": "Sickle hemoglobin polymerization involves not only \u00df6 Val in a largely hydrophobic acceptor pocket but other contact sites. We recently found that the \u00df73 His Hb S variant (\u00df6 Val and \u00df73 His) promoted polymerization compared to deoxy Hb S, while \u00df73 Leu Hb S (\u00df6 Val and \u00df73 Leu) inhibited polymerization like deoxy Hb C-Harlem (\u00df6 Val and \u00df73 Asn). In fact, \u00df73 Asp in Hb S makes a hydrogen bond with \u00df4 Thr in deoxy Hb S polymers, and this is a unique position to promote or inhibit polymerization by amino acid change [Adachi et al., Biochemistry (2003), 42, 4476]. Kinetics of polymerization, solubility and minimum concentration required for polymerization of the \u00df73 Hb S variants were affected by \u00df73 amino acid (inhibition of polymerization: His < <Asp <<Asn < Leu). Inhibition of Hb S \u00df73 Leu polymerization compared to Hb S may be caused by weakening of the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl group of \u00df4 Thr and the \u00df73 amino acid like Hb C-Harlem. Furthermore, kinetics of polymerization of 1:1 Hb S/Hb A \u00df73 His mixtures were enhanced compared to AS mixtures, while Hb S/Hb A \u00df73 Leu mixtures showed inhibitory effects similar to FS mixtures. These results suggest that the Hb A \u00df73His variant promotes Hb S polymerization almost as efficiently as Hb S \u00df73 His, and that the \u00df73 His in Hb A and Hb S variants strengthens the hydrogen bond with \u00df4 Thr, which helps facilitate formation of domains and 14-stranded fibers. Based on these results, we chemically synthesized a 15-mer EF helix peptide containing \u00df73 His (Lys-Lys-Val-Leu-Gly-Ala-Phe-Ser-His-Gly-Leu-Ala-His-Leu-Asp) and evaluated effects of this peptide on Hb S polymerization. DIC analysis in 1.0 M phosphate buffer showed peptide-induced inhibition of fiber elongation rate for deoxy-Hb S which increased linearly with increasing amounts of peptide (e.g., a 5-fold molar excess of peptide resulted in a 6-fold decrease in fiber elongation rate). Solubility of deoxy Hb S increased linearly with increasing peptide (e.g., a 5-fold molar excess of peptide increased solubility by 1.2-fold). The delay time prior to polymerization of deoxy Hb S in a high phosphate buffer also was increased significantly in the presence of this peptide. In contrast, the same 15-mer peptide containing \u00df73 Leu instead of His showed no effect on solubility or kinetics of polymerization, suggesting that the \u00df73 His peptide specifically affects the A-helix of Hb S containing \u00df4 Thr just like the \u00df73 His Hb S variant. This and possibly other peptides interrupting the \u00df73-\u00df4 interaction which result in inhibition of deoxy Hb S polymerization may be good candidates for inhibitors of Hb S polymerization."
