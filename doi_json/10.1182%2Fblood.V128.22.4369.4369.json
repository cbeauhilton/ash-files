    "abstract_text": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may be defined as a clonal expansion of mature B cells with stereotypic B cell receptors (BCR). Somatic hypermutation of the BCR heavy chains (IGVH) defines subgroups with different prognosis. In up to 10% of patients Richter's transformation to a high grade lymphoma with a mostly dismal prognosis is observed. The TCL1 transgenic mouse is a well accepted model of human CLL. Upon B cell-specific knock out of NFAT2, TCL1 mice develop a disease resembling Richter's syndrome with a significantly more aggressive disease phenotype. While TCL1 B cells exhibit tonic anergic BCR signaling characteristic of human CLL, loss of NFAT2 leads to readily activated BCRs indicating different BCR usage with altered downstream signaling. Here, we analyzed BCR usage in C57BL/6 wildtype, TCL1, and TCL1-NFAT2 -/- mice. Splenocyte cDNA of the respective animals at an age of 7 months was amplified by multiplex PCR covering known heavy chain VDJ alleles. The PCR products were subsequently cloned into standard bacterial plasmids and subjected to conventional DNA sequencing. In addition, PCR products were analyzed by next-generation-sequencing (NGS). For data analysis, the IMGT/HightV-QUEST online tool was applied. A very diverse and polyclonal BCR usage was found in wild type mice with more than 4000 different clones identified. Although TCL1 mice at 7 months of age exhibit all features of CLL, their BCR usage as analyzed by unambiguously identified VDJ recombination was still polyclonal. Only with respect to VH usage, TCL1 mice were found to use a more limited set of V alleles compared to wild type mice. Loss of NFAT2 by conditional knockout on the contrary, lead to an oligoclonal usage of VDJ recombination, to a further limitation of V alleles, and also to the usage of identical VDJ recombination in different mice with high frequency - indicating BCR selection either by antigen or self-signaling in these mice. Further analyses by sequencing of hypervariable regions showed preferential usage of mutated BCRs in TCL1 mice and of unmutated BCRs in NFAT2 ko mice reflecting benign and aggressive disease in humans. In summary, the loss of NFAT2 signaling in CLL prefers the selection of unmutated BCRs as well as the preferential usage of certain VDJ recombinations which results in the accelerated development of true oligoclonal disease.
