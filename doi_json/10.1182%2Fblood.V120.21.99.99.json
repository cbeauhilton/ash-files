    "abstract_text": "Abstract 99 Background: Von Willebrand disease (VWD) type 1 is characterized by a partial reduction of structurally and functionally normal VWF with normal VWF multimers. As part of a large European study (Molecular and Clinical Markers for the Diagnosis and Management of Type 1 von Willebrand Disease (MCMDM-1VWD) patients previously diagnosed with VWD type 1 were studied systematically to assess the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum. Objective: To confirm the pathogenicity of VWF gene mutations and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of VWD type 1. Patients and methods: VWD type 1 patients were recruited by twelve expert centers in nine European countries. VWF genotyping was performed in all index cases (IC). The eight mutations studied here are located in the VWF D'-D3 domain and corresponded to 57 patients from 19 families. They were reproduced by recombinant expression with subsequent phenotypic characterization, two of them in cis and one in trans with a second mutation. Results and Discussion: Intracellular VWF:Ag of all mutants was normal or near normal suggesting normal expression levels. However, seven mutations (p.M771I, p.I1094T, p.C1130R, p.C1130G, p.C1130F, p.W1144G and p.Y1146C) caused intracellular retention and impaired VWF secretion. In addition, we observed a major loss of high molecular weight multimers as in type 2A and a novel finding of a severe VWF:FVIII binding defect in most of the homozygously expressed mutants. Additional mutations either in cis or in trans had no modifying effect. The recombinant VWD type 1 Vicenza mutation p.R1205H with or without the allelic variant p.M740I seen in three Italian IC was secreted normally and had normal function leaving enhanced clearance of mutant VWF as the only pathomechanism. In conclusion, the majority of mutations in the D3 domain impair VWF multimerization, cause intracellular retention and correlate with defective FVIII binding. An elevated ratio of VWF propeptide to VWF:Ag suggests enhanced VWF clearance as an important pathomechanism of most mutations and particularly of p.R1205H.
